The last 25 years have been revolutionary in astronomy, as the field of
exoplanets has gone from no known planets outside the Solar System to thousands
discovered over the last year few years. This represents a rapid increase not
just in known planets (often referred to as Mamajek's Law), but also in total
planetary mass. What has been heretofore unaddressed, however, is that this
rapid increase in planetary masses may have disastrous consequences for the
future of humanity. We look at how the number of planets, and more importantly,
the mass of these planets has changed in the past and how we can expect this to
change in the future. The answers to those questions, and how we respond to
them, will determine if humanity is able to survive beyond the next 230 years.

My cat Chester investigates the elusive relationship between the appearance
in my hand of a silver laser pointer and that of a red dot on the wall, or on
the floor, or on any other object that resides within the vicinity of the laser
pointer. Chester first assesses preliminary establishments for causality,
including mutual information, temporal precedence, and control for third
variables. These assessments are all inconclusive for various reasons. In
particular, mutual information fails to illuminate the problem due to a dearth
of information regarding what the laser pointer might have been doing at times
following Chester's first awareness of the dot. Next Chester performs a formal
reconstruction of phase space via time-delay embedding, to unfold the
gggggggggggfffgfgtredvteometry
,mmmm.........,.,,......,.mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm of the
underlying dynamical system giving rise to the red dot's trajectory. The
resulting attractor does not resemble a laser pointer. The reconstruction
could, however, be flawed, for example, due to the short temporal duration of
the dot's observed trajectory. Finally, the red dot could be a hallucination: a
symptom brought on by COVID-19 - because, well, these days pretty much anything
might be a symptom brought on by COVID-19. On this note, Chester's kitten
brother Mad Dog Lapynski offers an independent check on the red dot's
existence. Moreover, the results of this study are inconclusive and
ca[pokilki[[[[[ll for follow-up.

<div class="abstract" style="display:none;"><br>
As a modern musician and cultural icon, Taylor Swift has earned worldwide
acclaim via pieces which predominantly draw upon the complex dynamics of
personal and interpersonal experiences. Here we show, for the first time, how
Swift's lyrical and melodic structure have evolved in their representation of
emotions over a timescale of $\tau\sim14$ yr. Previous progress on this topic
has been challenging based on the sheer volume of the relevant discography, and
that uniquely identifying a song that optimally describes a hypothetical
emotional state represents a multi-dimensional and complex task. To quantify
the emotional state of a song, we separate the criteria into the level of
optimism ($H$) and the strength of commitment to a relationship ($R$), based on
lyrics and chordal tones. We apply these criteria to a set of 149 pieces
spanning almost the entire repertoire. We find an overall trend toward positive
emotions in stronger relationships, with a best-fit linear relationship of
$R=0.642^{+0.086}_{-0.053}H-1.74^{+0.39}_{-0.29}$. We find no significant
trends in mean happiness ($H$) within individual albums over time. The mean
relationship score ($R$) shows trends which we speculate may be due to age and
the global pandemic. We provide tentative indications that partners with blue
eyes and/or bad reputations may lead to overall less positive emotions, while
those with green or indigo-colored eyes may produce more positive emotions and
stronger relationships. However, we stress that these trends are based on small
sample sizes, and more data are necessary to validate them. Finally, we present
the taylorswift python package which can be used to optimize song selection
according to a specific mood.

Phase resolved observations of planetary bodies allow us to understand the
longitudinal and latitudinal variations that make each one unique. Rotational
variations have been detected in several types of astronomical bodies beyond
those of planetary mass, including asteroids, brown dwarfs, and stars.
Unexpected rotational variations, such as those presented in this work, reminds
us that the universe can be complicated, with more mysteries to uncover. In
this work we present evidence for a new class of astronomical objects we
identify as "floofy" with observational distinctions between several sub-types
of these poorly understood objects. Using optical observations contributed by
the community, we have identified rotational variation in several of these
floofy objects, which suggests that they may have strong differences between
their hemispheres, likely caused by differing reflectivity off their surfaces.
Additional sub-types show no rotational variability suggesting a uniform
distribution of reflective elements on the floofy object. While the work here
is a promising step towards the categorization of floofy objects, further
observations with more strictly defined limits on background light,
illumination angles, and companion objects are necessary to develop a better
understanding of the many remaining mysteries of these astronomical objects.

<div class="abstract" style="display:none;"><br>
I conjecture an upper bound on the number of possible swampland conjectures
by comparing the entropy required by the conjectures themselves to the
Beckenstein-Hawking entropy of the cosmological horizon. Assuming of order 100
kilobits of entropy per conjecture, this places an upper bound of order
$10^{117}$ on the number of conjectures. I estimate the rate of production of
swampland conjectures by the number of papers listed on INSPIRE with the word
"swampland" in the title or abstract, which has been showing approximately
exponential growth since 2014. At the current rate of growth, the entropy bound
on the number of swampland conjectures can be projected to be saturated on a
timescale of order $10^{-8} H_0^{-1}$. I compare the upper bound from the
Swampland Conjecture Bound Conjecture (SCBC) to the estimated number of vacua
in the string landscape. Employing the duality suggested by AdS/CFT between the
quantum complexity of a holographic state and the volume of a Wheeler-Dewitt
spacetime patch, I place a conservative lower bound of order $\mathcal{N}_H >
10^{263}$ on the number of Hubble volumes in the multiverse which must be
driven to heat death to fully explore the string landscape via conjectural
methods.

Before Brexit, one of the greatest causes of arguments amongst British
families was the question of the nature of Jaffa Cakes. Some argue that their
size and host environment (the biscuit aisle) should make them a biscuit in
their own right. Others consider that their physical properties (e.g. they
harden rather than soften on becoming stale) suggest that they are in fact
cake. In order to finally put this debate to rest, we re-purpose technologies
used to classify transient events. We train two classifiers (a Random Forest
and a Support Vector Machine) on 100 recipes of traditional cakes and biscuits.
Our classifiers have 95 percent and 91 percent accuracy respectively. Finally
we feed two Jaffa Cake recipes to the algorithms and find that Jaffa Cakes are,
without a doubt, cakes. Finally, we suggest a new theory as to why some believe
Jaffa Cakes are biscuits.

levels with actual productivity levels. Over the last nine months, our group
self-reported 559 tasks, dates, and completion times -- expected and actual.
Here, I show which types of tasks we are the worst at completing in the

more senior researchers have more accurate expectations (spoiler: not much),

We propose a novel thermal production mechanism for dark matter based on the
idea that dark matter particles $\chi$ can transform (`infect') heat bath
particles $\psi$: $\chi \psi \rightarrow \chi \chi$. For a small initial
abundance of $\chi$ this induces an exponential growth in the dark matter
number density, closely resembling the epidemic curves of a spreading pathogen
after an initial outbreak. To quantify this relation we present a sharp duality
between the Boltzmann equation for the dark matter number density and
epidemiological models for the spread of infectious diseases. Finally we
demonstrate that the exponential growth naturally stops before $\chi$
thermalizes with the heat bath, corresponding to a triumphant `flattening of
the curve' that matches the observed dark matter abundance.

We revisit our 2013 claim [arXiv:1303.7476] that the Universe is the result
of a conspiratorial plot, and find that it cannot be trusted, because even the
belief in this conspiracy likely results from a conspiracy. On the basis of
mathematical beauty, the final results of the Planck mission, the exploration
of the dark sector by means of occult rituals and symbols, and a powerful new
philosophical approach to physics, we demonstrate here that not only the
existence of our Universe but the whole concept of reality has to be rejected
as obsolete and generally misleading. By introducing the new concept of the
"anthropogenic principle", we eventually illuminate the darkest corners of the
conspiracy behind the conspiracy and briefly discuss some important
implications regarding the survival of wo*mankind.

It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single human in possession of
a good space telescope, must be in search of a space vampire. Here, we showcase
our search for transit signatures of tidally locked space vampires, trapped in
the gravitational pull of late M-dwarfs. We generate forward models
representing two potential space vampire populations - those in bat shape and
those in humanoid shape. We search lightcurves from the Transiting Exo-Vampire
Survey Satellite (TEvSS) using a template matching algorithm and fit them using
our allesfitter software. Adding the information gained from TEvSS data, we
greatly decrease the uncertainty for the existence and occurrence rates of
space vampires, and constrain eta(space vampire) to a range of 0% to 100% (or
more). These precise analyses will be crucial for optimizing future observing
schedules for space-vampire characterization with the James Webb Space-Vampire
Telescope (JWSvT) and the Extremely-Large-Vampire Telescopes (ELvTs).

In the course of doing astronomy, one often encounters plots of densities,
for example probability densities, flux densities, and mass functions. Quite
frequently the ordinate of these diagrams is plotted logarithmically to
accommodate a large dynamic range. In this situation, I argue that it is
critical to adjust the density appropriately, rather than simply setting the
x-scale to `log' in your favorite plotting code. I will demonstrate the basic
issue with a pedagogical example, then mention a few common plots where this
may arise, and finally some possible exceptions to the rule.

We employ simulated annealing to identify the global solution of a dynamical
model, to make a favorable impression upon colleagues at the departmental
holiday party and then exit undetected as soon as possible. The procedure,
Gradual Freeze-out of an Optimal Estimation via Optimization of Parameter
Quantification - GFOOEOPQ, is designed for the socially awkward. The socially
awkward among us possess little instinct for pulling off such a maneuver, and
may benefit from a machine to do it for us. The method rests upon Bayes'
Theorem, where the probability of a future model state depends on current
knowledge of the model. Here, model state vectors are party attendees, and the
future event of interest is their disposition toward us at times following the
party. We want these dispositions to be favorable. To this end, we first
interact so as to make favorable impressions, or at least ensure that these
people remember having seen us there. Then we identify the exit that minimizes
the chance that anyone notes how early we high-tailed it. Now, poorly-resolved
estimates will correspond to degenerate solutions. As noted, we possess no
instinct to identify a global optimum by ourselves. This can have disastrous
consequences. For this reason, GFOOEOPQ employs annealing to iteratively home
in on this optimum. The method is illustrated via a simulated event hosted by
someone in the physics department (I am not sure who), in a two-bedroom
apartment on the fifth floor of an elevator building in Manhattan, with viable
Exit parameters: front door, side door to a stairwell, fire escape, and a
bathroom window that opens onto the fire escape. Preliminary tests are reported
at two real social celebrations. The procedure is generalizable to corporate
events and family gatherings. Readers are encouraged to report novel
applications of GFOOEOPQ, to expand the algorithm.

A mission to the focus of the solar gravitational lens could produce images
with unprecedented angular resolution and sensitivity. In the context of trying
to resolve the time variable thermal signature of continents on other
Earth-like exoplanets, we develop an approach to improve the image
reconstruction performance by using azimuthal variations in the Einstein Ring's
intensity. In the first post-Newtonian approximation to General Relativity, an
arbitrary disk intensity distribution in the source plane is mapped to a narrow
annulus around the Einstein Ring, with each azimuthal element corresponding to
a sector in the disk. A matrix-based linear measurement model at various fixed
signal-to-noise ratios demonstrates that this extra information is useful in
improving the reconstruction when the image is sparsely sampled, which could
improve integration times and temporal errors. Various issues and future
outlooks are discussed.

Since the discovery of the first confirmed exoplanet, observations have
revealed a remarkable diversity of worlds. A wide variety of orbital and
physical characteristics are detected in the exoplanet population, and much
work has been devoted to deciding which of these planets may be suitable for
life. Until now, though, little work has been devoted to deciding which of the
potentially habitable planets might actually be \textit{worth} existing on. To
this end, we present the Really Habitable Zone (RHZ), defined as the region
around a star where acceptable gins and tonic are likely to be abundant. In
common with much of the work in the field, we rely throughout on assumptions
which are difficult if not impossible to test and present some plots which

Godwin's law, i.e. the empirical observation that as an online discussion
grows in time, the probability of a comparison with Nazis or Hitler quickly
approaches unity, is one of the best-documented facts of the internet.
Anticipating the quantum internet, here we show under reasonable model
assumptions a polynomial quantum speedup of Godwin's law. Concretely, in
quantum discussions, Hitler will be mentioned on average quadratically earlier,
and we conjecture that under specific network topologies, even cubic speedups
are possible. We also show that the speedup cannot be more than exponential,
unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to a certain finite level. We report
on numerical experiments to simulate the appearance of the quantum Godwin law
in future quantum internets; the most amazing finding of our studies is that --
unlike quantum computational speedups -- the quantum Godwin effect is not only
robust against noise, but actually enhanced by decoherence. We have as yet no
theoretical explanation, nor a good application, for this astonishing
behaviour, which we dub quantum hyperpiesia.

Evidence has continued to accumulate over the last few decades as to the
existence and nature of dark matter. Depending on the particle candidate, the
dark matter can exhibit one of several cosmologically defined models: hot dark
matter, cold dark matter, warm dark matter, self-interacting dark matter, and
fuzzy dark matter. In this paper I review the relevance and status of these
models, whether it is possible for more than one of these models to each
constitute some fraction of the dark matter, and discuss the prospects for
determining if any of these models can successfully describe the properties and
evolution of our own Universe.

the boundary between the landscape of consistent low-energy limits of quantum
gravity, and the swampland of theories that cannot be embedded within string
theory because they violate certain trendy and obviously uncontroversial
conjectures. The Marshland is probably fractal, and we show some pretty
pictures of fractals that will be useful in talks. We further show that the
Marshland contains theories with a large number of light axions, allowing us to
cite lots of our own papers. We show that the Marshland makes up most of the

Despite a previous description of his state as a stable fixed point, just
past midnight this morning Mr. Boddy was murdered again. In fact, over 70 years
Mr. Boddy has been reported murdered $10^6$ times, while there exist no
documented attempts at intervention. Using variational data assimilation, we
train a model of Mr. Boddy's dynamics on the time series of observed murders,
to forecast future murders. The parameters to be estimated include instrument,
location, and murderer. We find that a successful estimation requires three
additional elements. First, to minimize the effects of selection bias, generous
ranges are placed on parameter searches, permitting values such as the Cliff,
the Poisoned Apple, and the Wife. Second, motive, which was not considered
relevant to previous murders, is added as a parameter. Third, Mr. Boddy's
little-known asthmatic condition is considered as an alternative cause of
death. Following this morning's event, the next local murder is forecast for
17:19:03 EDT this afternoon, with a standard deviation of seven hours, at The
Kitchen at 4330 Katonah Avenue, Bronx, NY, 10470, with either the Lead Pipe or
the Lead Bust of Washington Irving. The motive is: Case of Mistaken Identity,
and there was no convergence upon a murderer. Testing of the procedure's
predictive power will involve catching the D train to 205th Street and a few
transfers over to Katonah Avenue, and sitting around waiting with our eyes
peeled. We discuss the problem of identifying a global solution - that is, the
best reason for murder on a landscape riddled with pretty-decent reasons. We
also discuss the procedure's assumption of Gaussian-distributed errors, which
will under-predict rare events. This under-representation of highly improbable
events may be offset by the fact that the training data, after all, consists of
multiple murders of a single person.

Many previous authors have attempted to find explanations for Westeros's
climate, characterized by a generally moderate, Earth-like climate punctuated
by extremely long and cold winters, separated by thousands of years. One
explanation that has been proposed is that the planet orbits in a Sitnikov
configuration, where two equal-mass stars (or a star and a black hole) orbit
each other on slightly eccentric orbits, and the planet moves along a line
through the barycenter perpendicular to the primaries' orbital plane
(Freistetter & Gr\"utzbauch 2018). We modify an intermediate-complexity GCM to
include the effects of such an orbit and integrate it for thousands of years to
determine whether such an orbit can a) be habitable and b) explain the climatic
variations observed by the inhabitants of Westeros, in both double-star and
star-black hole configurations. While configurations with low primary
eccentricity and initial conditions that permit only small excursions from the
ecliptic plane are habitable, these orbits are too stable to explain Westerosi
climate. We find that while orbits with more bounded chaos are able to produce
rare anomalously long and cold winters similar to Westeros's Long Night, huge
variations in incident stellar flux on normal orbital timescales should render
these planets uninhabitable. We note that the presence of an orbital
megastructure, either around the planet or the barycenter, could block some of
the sunlight during crossings of the primaries' orbital plane and preserve
Westeros's habitability. While we find that bounded chaotic Sitnikov orbits are
a viable explanation for Westeros's Long Night, we propose that chaotic
variations of the planet's axial tilt or semimajor axis, potentially due to
torques from nearby planets or stars, may be a more realistic explanation than
Sitnikov orbits.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are, as the name implies, short and intense pulses
of radiation at wavelengths of roughly one metre. FRBs have extremely high
brightness temperatures, which points to a coherent source of radiation. The
energy of a single burst ranges from $10^{36}$ to $10^{39}$ erg. At the high
end of the energy range, FRBs have enough energy to unbind an earth-sized
planet, and even at the low end, there is enough energy to vaporise and unbind
the atmosphere and the oceans. We therefore propose that FRBs are signatures of
an artificial terraformer, capable of eradicating life on another planet, or
even destroy the planet entirely. The necessary energy can be harvested from
Wolf-Rayet stars with a Dyson sphere ($\sim 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$) , and the
radiation can be readily produced by astrophysical masers. We refer to this
mechanism as Volatile Amplification of a Destructive Emission of Radiation
(VADER). We use the observational information to constrain the properties of
the apparatus. We speculate that the non-repeating FRBs are low-energy pulses
used to exterminate life on a single planet, but leaving it otherwise intact,
and that the stronger repeating FRB is part of an effort to destroy multiple
objects in the same solar system, perhaps as a preventative measure against
panspermia. In this picture, the persistent synchrotron source associated with
the first repeating FRB arises from the energy harvesting process. Finally we
propose that Oumuamua might have resulted from a destruction of a planet in
this manner.

With the wealth of planets that have been discovered over the past $\sim$ 20
years, the field can broadly be divided into two regimes. For understanding
broad occurrence and formation rates, large numbers of planets allow for
population statistics to be calculated, and this work preferentially tends
towards fainter planets (and fainter host stars) to allow for a large number of
detections. The second regime is the detailed understanding of a single planet,
with particular consideration to planetary structure and atmosphere, and in
this case benefits from finding individual planets (and host stars) that are
very close, and subsequently, very bright. The closest of these also provide
very novel possibilities for exploration if they are close enough that travel
time to them is relatively low, something that would be extremely unlikely for
more distant planets. Here, we announce the independent discovery of a
sub-earth planet orbiting in the habitable zone of a very close solar-mass star
using a novel processing technique and observations from the Kilodegree
Extremely Little Telescope (KELT).

"Winter is coming". As far as meteorological predictions go, the words of

The natives of Westeros have failed to develop a feasible model to understand
and predict the coming and duration of their winters. And although the
scientists of Earth have brought forth many different mechanisms to explain the
seasons, all of them are found wanting (at least by us). Nobody seems to have
discovered the one and only true and working mechanism to explain the coming
and going of winters on Westeros and thus it is up to us to introduce the world
to the might of the often ignored Sitnikov problem. That very special

Many rocky exoplanets are heavier and larger than Earth, so-called

Super-Earthlings. Due to the higher surface gravity on these worlds,
space-flight is much more challenging. We find that chemical rockets still
allow for escape velocities on Super-Earths up to 10x Earth mass. Much heavier
rocky worlds, if they exist, will require using up most of the planet as
chemical fuel for the (one) launch, a rather risky undertaking. We also briefly

a single hidden layer to predict Barry Cottonfield's likely reply to this
author's invitation to the "Once Upon a Daydream" junior prom at the Conard
High School gymnasium back in 1997. To examine the network's ability to
generalize to such a situation beyond specific training scenarios, we use a L2
regularization term in the cost function and examine performance over a range
of regularization strengths. In addition, we examine the nonsensical
decision-making strategies that emerge in Barry at times when he has recently
engaged in a fight with his annoying kid sister Janice. To simulate Barry's
inability to learn efficiently from large mistakes (an observation well
documented by his algebra teacher during sophomore year), we choose a simple
quadratic form for the cost function, so that the weight update magnitude is
not necessary correlated with the magnitude of output error.
  Network performance on test data indicates that this author would have
received an 87.2 (1)% chance of "Yes" given a particular set of environmental
input parameters. Most critically, the optimal method of question delivery is
found to be Secret Note rather than Verbal Speech. There also exists mild
evidence that wearing a burgundy mini-dress might have helped. The network
performs comparably for all values of regularization strength, which suggests
that the nature of noise in a high school hallway during passing time does not
affect much of anything. We comment on possible biases inherent in the output,
implications regarding the functionality of a real biological network, and
future directions. Over-training is also discussed, although the linear algebra

While the costs of human violence have attracted a great deal of attention
from the research community, the effects of the network-on-network (NoN)
violence popularised by Generative Adversarial Networks have yet to be
addressed. In this work, we quantify the financial, social, spiritual,
cultural, grammatical and dermatological impact of this aggression and address
the issue by proposing a more peaceful approach which we term Generative
Unadversarial Networks (GUNs). Under this framework, we simultaneously train
two models: a generator G that does its best to capture whichever data
distribution it feels it can manage, and a motivator M that helps G to achieve
its dream. Fighting is strictly verboten and both models evolve by learning to
respect their differences. The framework is both theoretically and electrically
grounded in game theory, and can be viewed as a winner-shares-all two-player
game in which both players work as a team to achieve the best score.
Experiments show that by working in harmony, the proposed model is able to
claim both the moral and log-likelihood high ground. Our work builds on a rich
history of carefully argued position-papers, published as anonymous YouTube
comments, which prove that the optimal solution to NoN violence is more GUNs.

We present a functional model of neuronal network connectivity in which the
single architectural element is the object commonly known in handicraft circles
as a pipe cleaner. We argue that the dual nature of a neuronal circuit - that
it be at times highly robust to external manipulation and yet sufficiently
flexible to allow for learning and adaptation - is embodied in the pipe
cleaner, and thus that a pipe cleaner framework serves as an instructive
scaffold in which to examine network dynamics. Regarding the dynamics
themselves: as pipe cleaners possess no intrinsic dynamics, in our model we
attribute the emergent circuit dynamics to magic. Magic is a strategy that has
been largely neglected in the neuroscience community, and may serve as an
illuminating comparison to the common physics-based approaches. This model
makes predictions that it would be really awesome to test experimentally.
Moreover, the relative simplicity of the pipe cleaner - setting aside the fact
that it comes in an overwhelming variety of colors - renders it an excellent
theoretical building block with which to create simple network models. Also,
they are incredibly cheap when bought wholesale on Amazon.

that there are equally surprising features in the digits of the number $\pi$,
and moreover there is a remarkable correspondence between each type of
peculiarity in the digits of $\pi$ and the anomalies in the CMB. Putting aside
the unreasonable possibility that these are just the sort of flukes that appear

the population of known exoplanets. Beyond the strictly scientific questions
that this has led to regarding planet formation and frequency, this has also

Since its discovery in 1930, Pluto's mass has been a value that has
repeatedly been calculated. Additionally, the search for Planet X prior to
Pluto's discovery results in mass calculations that date back several decades
earlier. Over its observed history, the mass of Pluto has consistently
decreased. We reassess earlier predictions of Pluto's fate, and rule out the
hypothesis that Pluto's mass has been constant over the last century. We are
able to fit linear and quadratic equations to Pluto's mass as a function of
both time and distance. The observations that will be made by New Horizons will
help to determine if we can expect Pluto to continue to shrink until it has
negative mass, or if it will begin to increase in mass again.

Some of the most obviously correct physical theories - namely string theory
and the multiverse - make no testable predictions, leading many to question
whether we should accept something as scientific even if it makes no testable
predictions and hence is not refutable. However, some far-thinking physicists
have proposed instead that we should give up on the notion of Falsifiability
itself. We endorse this suggestion but think it does not go nearly far enough.
We believe that we should also dispense with other outdated ideas, such as
Fidelity, Frugality, Factuality and other "F" words. And we quote a lot of
famous people to support this view.

Recent microwave polarization measurements from the BICEP2 experiment may
reveal a long-sought signature of inflation. However, these new results appear
inconsistent with the best-fit model from the Planck satellite. We suggest a
particularly simple idea for reconciling these data-sets, and for explaining a

Those that do not sow care little about such mundane things as equinoxes or
planting seasons, or even crop rotation for that matter. Wherever and whenever
the reavers reave, the mood is always foul and the nights are never warm or
pleasant. For the rest of the good folks of Westeros, however, a decent grasp
of the long-term weather forecast is a necessity. Many a maester have tried to
play the Game of Weather Patterns and foretell when to plant those last turnip
seeds, hoping for a few more years of balmy respite. Tried and failed. For
other than the somewhat vague (if not outright meaningless) omens of "Winter is
Coming", their meteorological efforts have been worse than useless. To right
that appalling wrong, here we attempt to explain the apparently erratic
seasonal changes in the world of G.R.R.M. A natural explanation for such
phenomena is the unique behavior of a circumbinary planet. Thus, by speculating
that the planet under scrutiny is orbiting a pair of stars, we utilize the
power of numerical three-body dynamics to predict that, unfortunately, it is
not possible to predict either the length, or the severity of any coming
winter. We conclude that, alas, the Maesters were right -- one can only throw
their hands in the air in frustration and, defeated by non-analytic solutions,
mumble "Coming winter? May be long and nasty (~850 days, T<268K) or may be
short and sweet (~600 days, T~273K). Who knows..."

Based on the cosmological results of the Planck Mission, we show that all
parameters describing our Universe within the \Lambda CDM model can be
constructed from a small set of numbers known from conspiracy theory. Our
finding is confirmed by recent data from high energy particle physics. This
clearly demonstrates that our Universe is a plot initiated by an unknown
interest group or lodge. We analyse possible scenarios for this conspiracy, and
conclude that the belief in the existence of our Universe is an illusion, as
previously assumed by ancient philosophers, 20th century science fiction
authors and contemporary film makers.

Existing and future wide-field photometric surveys will produce a time-lapse
movie of the sky that will revolutionize our census of variable and moving
astronomical and atmospheric phenomena. As with any revolution in scientific
measurement capability, this new species of data will also present us with
results that are sure to surprise and confound our understanding of the cosmos.
While we cannot predict the unknown yields of such endeavors, it is a
beneficial exercise to explore certain parameter spaces using reasonable
assumptions for rates and observability. To this end I present a simple
parameterized model of the detectability of unidentified flying objects (UFOs)
with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). I also demonstrate that the
LSST is well suited to place the first systematic constraints on the rate of
UFO and extraterrestrial visits to our world.

I present here a measurement of pi as determined for the largest observable

strongly disfavored relative to 22/7, another popular value. The oft-used

We have identified a new class of galaxy cluster using data from the Galaxy
Zoo project. These clusters are rare, and thus have apparently gone unnoticed
before, despite their unusual properties. They appear especially anomalous when
the morphological properties of their component galaxies are considered. Their
identification therefore depends upon the visual inspection of large numbers of
galaxies, a feat which has only recently been made possible by Galaxy Zoo,
together with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We present the basic properties of
our cluster sample, and discuss possible formation scenarios and implications
for cosmology.

It is now well accepted that both Dark Matter and Dark Energy are required in
any successful cosmological model. Although there is ample evidence that both
Dark components are necessary, the conventional theories make no prediction for
the contributions from each of them. Moreover, there is usually no intrinsic
relationship between the two components, and no understanding of the nature of
the mysteries of the Dark Sector. Here we suggest that if the Dark Side is so
seductive then we should not be restricted to just 2 components. We further
suggest that the most natural model has 5 distinct forms of Dark Energy in
addition to the usual Dark Matter, each contributing precisely equally to the
cosmic energy density budget.
