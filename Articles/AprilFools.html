We revisit our 2013 claim [arXiv:1303.7476] that the Universe is the result
of a conspiratorial plot, and find that it cannot be trusted, as even the
belief in this conspiracy likely results from a conspiracy. On the basis of
mathematical beauty, the final results of the Planck mission, the exploration
of the dark sector by means of occult rituals and symbols, and a powerful new
philosophical approach to physics, we demonstrate here that not only the
existence of our Universe, but the whole concept of reality has to be rejected
as obsolete and generally misleading. By introducing the new concept of the
"anthropogenic principle", we eventually illuminate the darkest corners of the
conspiracy behind the conspiracy and briefly discuss some important
implications regarding the survival of wo*mankind.

It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single human in possession of
a good space telescope, must be in search of a space vampire. Here, we showcase
our search for transit signatures of tidally locked space vampires, trapped in
the gravitational pull of late M-dwarfs. We generate forward models
representing two potential space vampire populations - those in bat shape and
those in humanoid shape. We search lightcurves from the Transiting Exo-Vampire
Survey Satellite (TEvSS) using a template matching algorithm and fit them using
our allesfitter software. Adding the information gained from TEvSS data, we
greatly decrease the uncertainty for the existence and occurrence rates of
space vampires, and constrain eta(space vampire) to a range of 0% to 100% (or
more). These precise analyses will be crucial for optimizing future observing
schedules for space-vampire characterization with the James Webb Space-Vampire
Telescope (JWSvT) and the Extremely-Large-Vampire Telescopes (ELvTs).

In the course of doing astronomy, one often encounters plots of densities,
for example probability densities, flux densities, and mass functions. Quite
frequently the ordinate of these diagrams is plotted logarithmically to
accommodate a large dynamic range. In this situation, I argue that it is
critical to adjust the density appropriately, rather than simply setting the
x-scale to `log' in your favorite plotting code. I will demonstrate the basic
issue with a pedagogical example, then mention a few common plots where this
may arise, and finally some possible exceptions to the rule.

A long-standing problem of observing Room Temperature Superconductivity is
finally solved by a novel approach. Instead of increasing the critical
temperature Tc of a superconductor, the temperature of the room was decreased

Superconductivity in the near future.

We employ simulated annealing to identify the global solution of a dynamical
model, to make a favorable impression upon colleagues at the departmental
holiday party and then exit undetected as soon as possible. The procedure,
Gradual Freeze-out of an Optimal Estimation via Optimization of Parameter
Quantification - GFOOEOPQ, is designed for the socially awkward. The socially
awkward among us possess little instinct for pulling off such a maneuver, and
may benefit from a machine to do it for us. The method rests upon Bayes'
Theorem, where the probability of a future model state depends on current
knowledge of the model. Here, model state vectors are party attendees, and the
future event of interest is their disposition toward us at times following the
party. We want these dispositions to be favorable. To this end, we first
interact so as to make favorable impressions, or at least ensure that these
people remember having seen us there. Then we identify the exit that minimizes
the chance that anyone notes how early we high-tailed it. Now, poorly-resolved
estimates will correspond to degenerate solutions. As noted, we possess no
instinct to identify a global optimum by ourselves. This can have disastrous
consequences. For this reason, GFOOEOPQ employs annealing to iteratively home
in on this optimum. The method is illustrated via a simulated event hosted by
someone in the physics department (I am not sure who), in a two-bedroom
apartment on the fifth floor of an elevator building in Manhattan, with viable
Exit parameters: front door, side door to a stairwell, fire escape, and a
bathroom window that opens onto the fire escape. Preliminary tests are reported
at two real social celebrations. The procedure is generalizable to corporate
events and family gatherings. Readers are encouraged to report novel
applications of GFOOEOPQ, to expand the algorithm.

Exploring the Universe is one of the great unifying themes of humanity. Part
of this endeavour is the search for extraterrestrial life. But how likely is it
that we will find life, or that if we do it will be similar to ourselves? And
therefore how do we know where and how to look? We give examples of the sort of
reasoning that has been used to narrow and focus this search and we argue that
obvious extensions to that logical framework will result in greater success.

A mission to the focus of the solar gravitational lens could produce images
with unprecedented angular resolution and sensitivity. In the context of trying
to resolve the time variable thermal signature of continents on other
Earth-like exoplanets, we develop an approach to improve the image
reconstruction performance by using azimuthal variations in the Einstein Ring's
intensity. In the first post-Newtonian approximation to General Relativity, an
arbitrary disk intensity distribution in the source plane is mapped to a narrow
annulus around the Einstein Ring, with each azimuthal element corresponding to
a sector in the disk. A matrix-based linear measurement model at various fixed
signal-to-noise ratios demonstrates that this extra information is useful in
improving the reconstruction when the image is sparsely sampled, which could
improve integration times and temporal errors. Various issues and future
outlooks are discussed.

seen much more rainfall than would otherwise be expected, an increase of over
200%. We further look at a number of observatory sites in areas that are facing

follow from telescope allocation committees providing us an inordinate amount
of telescope time at facilities located around the globe.

Since the discovery of the first confirmed exoplanet, observations have
revealed a remarkable diversity of worlds. A wide variety of orbital and
physical characteristics are detected in the exoplanet population, and much
work has been devoted to deciding which of these planets may be suitable for
life. Until now, though, little work has been devoted to deciding which of the
potentially habitable planets might actually be \textit{worth} existing on. To
this end, we present the Really Habitable Zone (RHZ), defined as the region
around a star where acceptable gins and tonic are likely to be abundant. In
common with much of the work in the field, we rely throughout on assumptions
which are difficult if not impossible to test and present some plots which
astronomers can use in their own talks, stripped of all caveats. We suggest
that planets in the Really Habitable Zone be early targets for the JWST,
because by the time that thing finally launches we're all going to need a
drink.

<div class="abstract" style="display:none;"><br>
Godwin's law, i.e. the empirical observation that as an online discussion
grows in time, the probability of a comparison with Nazis or Hitler quickly
approaches unity, is one of the best-documented facts of the internet.
Anticipating the quantum internet, here we show under reasonable model
assumptions a polynomial quantum speedup of Godwin's law. Concretely, in
quantum discussions, Hitler will be mentioned on average quadratically earlier,
and we conjecture that under specific network topologies, even cubic speedups
are possible. We also show that the speedup cannot be more than exponential,
unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to a certain finite level. We report
on numerical experiments to simulate the appearance of the quantum Godwin law
in future quantum internets; the most amazing finding of our studies is that --
unlike quantum computational speedups -- the quantum Godwin effect is not only
robust against noise, but actually enhanced by decoherence. We have as yet no
theoretical explanation, nor a good application, for this astonishing
behaviour, which we dub quantum hyperpiesia.

Evidence has continued to accumulate over the last few decades as to the
existence and nature of dark matter. Depending on the particle candidate, the
dark matter can exhibit one of several cosmologically defined models: hot dark
matter, cold dark matter, warm dark matter, self-interacting dark matter, and
fuzzy dark matter. In this paper I review the relevance and status of these
models, whether it is possible for more than one of these models to each
constitute some fraction of the dark matter, and discuss the prospects for
determining if any of these models can successfully describe the properties and
evolution of our own Universe.

We posit the existence of the Marshland within string theory. This region is
the boundary between the landscape of consistent low-energy limits of quantum
gravity, and the swampland of theories that cannot be embedded within string
theory because they violate certain trendy and obviously uncontroversial
conjectures. The Marshland is probably fractal, and we show some pretty
pictures of fractals that will be useful in talks. We further show that the
Marshland contains theories with a large number of light axions, allowing us to
cite lots of our own papers. We show that the Marshland makes up most of the
volume of the landscape, and admits a novel, weakly broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$
Marshymmetry that we find strong evidence for by considering a carefully
crafted example.

Many previous authors have attempted to find explanations for Westeros's
climate, characterized by a generally moderate, Earth-like climate punctuated
by extremely long and cold winters, separated by thousands of years. One
explanation that has been proposed is that the planet orbits in a Sitnikov
configuration, where two equal-mass stars (or a star and a black hole) orbit
each other on slightly eccentric orbits, and the planet moves along a line
through the barycenter perpendicular to the primaries' orbital plane
(Freistetter & Gr\"utzbauch 2018). We modify an intermediate-complexity GCM to
include the effects of such an orbit and integrate it for thousands of years to
determine whether such an orbit can a) be habitable and b) explain the climatic
variations observed by the inhabitants of Westeros, in both double-star and
star-black hole configurations. While configurations with low primary
eccentricity and initial conditions that permit only small excursions from the
ecliptic plane are habitable, these orbits are too stable to explain Westerosi
climate. We find that while orbits with more bounded chaos are able to produce
rare anomalously long and cold winters similar to Westeros's Long Night, huge
variations in incident stellar flux on normal orbital timescales should render
these planets uninhabitable. We note that the presence of an orbital
megastructure, either around the planet or the barycenter, could block some of
the sunlight during crossings of the primaries' orbital plane and preserve
Westeros's habitability. While we find that bounded chaotic Sitnikov orbits are
a viable explanation for Westeros's Long Night, we propose that chaotic
variations of the planet's axial tilt or semimajor axis, potentially due to
torques from nearby planets or stars, may be a more realistic explanation than
Sitnikov orbits.

<div class="abstract" style="display:none;"><br>
Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are, as the name implies, short and intense pulses
of radiation at wavelengths of roughly one metre. FRBs have extremely high
brightness temperatures, which points to a coherent source of radiation. The
energy of a single burst ranges from $10^{36}$ to $10^{39}$ erg. At the high
end of the energy range, FRBs have enough energy to unbind an earth-sized
planet, and even at the low end, there is enough energy to vaporise and unbind
the atmosphere and the oceans. We therefore propose that FRBs are signatures of
an artificial terraformer, capable of eradicating life on another planet, or
even destroy the planet entirely. The necessary energy can be harvested from
Wolf-Rayet stars with a Dyson sphere ($\sim 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$) , and the
radiation can be readily produced by astrophysical masers. We refer to this
mechanism as Volatile Amplification of a Destructive Emission of Radiation
(VADER). We use the observational information to constrain the properties of
the apparatus. We speculate that the non-repeating FRBs are low-energy pulses
used to exterminate life on a single planet, but leaving it otherwise intact,
and that the stronger repeating FRB is part of an effort to destroy multiple
objects in the same solar system, perhaps as a preventative measure against
panspermia. In this picture, the persistent synchrotron source associated with
the first repeating FRB arises from the energy harvesting process. Finally we
propose that Oumuamua might have resulted from a destruction of a planet in
this manner.

"Winter is coming". As far as meteorological predictions go, the words of
House Stark are both trivial and not very helpful for a scientific analysis to
explain the chaotic sequence of the seasons in the world of "Game of Thrones".
The natives of Westeros have failed to develop a feasible model to understand
and predict the coming and duration of their winters. And although the
scientists of Earth have brought forth many different mechanisms to explain the
seasons, all of them are found wanting (at least by us). Nobody seems to have
discovered the one and only true and working mechanism to explain the coming
and going of winters on Westeros and thus it is up to us to introduce the world
to the might of the often ignored Sitnikov problem. That very special
configuration of two stars and one planet is ideally suited to explain
everything that needs to be explained and uncover the real reason for the

Many rocky exoplanets are heavier and larger than Earth, so-called

Super-Earthlings. Due to the higher surface gravity on these worlds,
space-flight is much more challenging. We find that chemical rockets still
allow for escape velocities on Super-Earths up to 10x Earth mass. Much heavier
rocky worlds, if they exist, will require using up most of the planet as
chemical fuel for the (one) launch, a rather risky undertaking. We also briefly
discuss launching rockets from water worlds, which requires Alien

While the costs of human violence have attracted a great deal of attention

the issue by proposing a more peaceful approach which we term Generative
Unadversarial Networks (GUNs). Under this framework, we simultaneously train
two models: a generator G that does its best to capture whichever data
distribution it feels it can manage, and a motivator M that helps G to achieve
its dream. Fighting is strictly verboten and both models evolve by learning to
respect their differences. The framework is both theoretically and electrically
grounded in game theory, and can be viewed as a winner-shares-all two-player
game in which both players work as a team to achieve the best score.
Experiments show that by working in harmony, the proposed model is able to
claim both the moral and log-likelihood high ground. Our work builds on a rich
history of carefully argued position-papers, published as anonymous YouTube
comments, which prove that the optimal solution to NoN violence is more GUNs.

Deviations of the observed cosmic microwave background (CMB) from the
standard model, known as "anomalies", are obviously highly significant and
deserve to be pursued more aggressively in order to discover the physical
phenomena underlying them. Through intensive investigation we have discovered
that there are equally surprising features in the digits of the number $\pi$,
and moreover there is a remarkable correspondence between each type of
peculiarity in the digits of $\pi$ and the anomalies in the CMB. Putting aside
the unreasonable possibility that these are just the sort of flukes that appear
when one looks hard enough, the only conceivable conclusion is that, however
the CMB anomalies were created, a similar process imprinted patterns in the
digits of $\pi$.

Some of the most obviously correct physical theories - namely string theory
and the multiverse - make no testable predictions, leading many to question
whether we should accept something as scientific even if it makes no testable
predictions and hence is not refutable. However, some far-thinking physicists
have proposed instead that we should give up on the notion of Falsifiability
itself. We endorse this suggestion but think it does not go nearly far enough.
We believe that we should also dispense with other outdated ideas, such as
Fidelity, Frugality, Factuality and other "F" words. And we quote a lot of
famous people to support this view.

Those that do not sow care little about such mundane things as equinoxes or
planting seasons, or even crop rotation for that matter. Wherever and whenever
the reavers reave, the mood is always foul and the nights are never warm or
pleasant. For the rest of the good folks of Westeros, however, a decent grasp
of the long-term weather forecast is a necessity. Many a maester have tried to
play the Game of Weather Patterns and foretell when to plant those last turnip
seeds, hoping for a few more years of balmy respite. Tried and failed. For
other than the somewhat vague (if not outright meaningless) omens of "Winter is
Coming", their meteorological efforts have been worse than useless. To right
that appalling wrong, here we attempt to explain the apparently erratic
seasonal changes in the world of G.R.R.M. A natural explanation for such
phenomena is the unique behavior of a circumbinary planet. Thus, by speculating
that the planet under scrutiny is orbiting a pair of stars, we utilize the
power of numerical three-body dynamics to predict that, unfortunately, it is
not possible to predict either the length, or the severity of any coming
winter. We conclude that, alas, the Maesters were right -- one can only throw
their hands in the air in frustration and, defeated by non-analytic solutions,
mumble "Coming winter? May be long and nasty (~850 days, T<268K) or may be
short and sweet (~600 days, T~273K). Who knows..."

Based on the cosmological results of the Planck Mission, we show that all
parameters describing our Universe within the \Lambda CDM model can be
constructed from a small set of numbers known from conspiracy theory. Our
finding is confirmed by recent data from high energy particle physics. This
clearly demonstrates that our Universe is a plot initiated by an unknown
interest group or lodge. We analyse possible scenarios for this conspiracy, and
conclude that the belief in the existence of our Universe is an illusion, as
previously assumed by ancient philosophers, 20th century science fiction

Existing and future wide-field photometric surveys will produce a time-lapse
movie of the sky that will revolutionize our census of variable and moving
astronomical and atmospheric phenomena. As with any revolution in scientific
measurement capability, this new species of data will also present us with
results that are sure to surprise and confound our understanding of the cosmos.
While we cannot predict the unknown yields of such endeavors, it is a
beneficial exercise to explore certain parameter spaces using reasonable
assumptions for rates and observability. To this end I present a simple
parameterized model of the detectability of unidentified flying objects (UFOs)
with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). I also demonstrate that the
LSST is well suited to place the first systematic constraints on the rate of
UFO and extraterrestrial visits to our world.

the morphological properties of their component galaxies are considered. Their
identification therefore depends upon the visual inspection of large numbers of
galaxies, a feat which has only recently been made possible by Galaxy Zoo,
together with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We present the basic properties of
our cluster sample, and discuss possible formation scenarios and implications
for cosmology.

It is now well accepted that both Dark Matter and Dark Energy are required in

Dark components are necessary, the conventional theories make no prediction for
the contributions from each of them. Moreover, there is usually no intrinsic
relationship between the two components, and no understanding of the nature of
the mysteries of the Dark Sector. Here we suggest that if the Dark Side is so
seductive then we should not be restricted to just 2 components. We further
suggest that the most natural model has 5 distinct forms of Dark Energy in
addition to the usual Dark Matter, each contributing precisely equally to the
cosmic energy density budget.
