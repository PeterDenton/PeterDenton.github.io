<div class="abstract" style="display:none;"><br>
Current leading theories of physics such as the Big Bang, the standard model
of particle physics, and general relativity suggest that the universe should
contain an equal amount of matter and antimatter. Yet observations have found a
disproportionately large amount of matter, a phenomenon known as the baryon
assymmetry problem. Since century-old established theories are traditionally
impossible to refute, the only possible explanation is that the remaining
antimatter is hidden in plain sight and remains to be observed. We propose the
existence of anti-stars to solve the baryon assymetry in our new Reasonable
Antimatter Theory of Stars (RATS). In this context, the RATS will create a
framework to resolve the traditional tension between observers and theorists,
and thus contribute to the peaceful and collaborative spirit of astronomy. Our
method is the firing of neurons in our brains, typically known as a thought
experiment. We still have no idea why or how this works, but it must be good
because most of science was created this way. Our results are the result of our
methods, which result in some text and the resulting conclusions. In order to
encourage the reader to reach the end of this short paper, we do not want to
spoil the conclusions here. Instead, the conclusions will conclude the paper.

In an effort to reduce drain on grant funds and decrease unused space in
publications, we have developed a Python package for inserting advertisements
into the space left empty by corner plots. This novel technique can allow
authors to reduce or eliminate publication charges for journals such as MNRAS
and ApJ. In order to offset publication costs entirely, we recommend that
authors include anywhere from 200-700 corner plots per paper, with the exact
number depending on the journal used. Finally, we discuss other opportunities
to generate ad revenue through publications.

Popular culture plays a significant role in shaping public interest in
science, and Taylor Swift's discography frequently incorporates astrophysics
terminology. This study examines the occurrence of astrophysics-related words
in her lyrics and their representation in the Eras tour set list. By analyzing
the frequency of words in Swift's total discography, we identify that
astrophysics is promoted the most within her most recent album, The Tortured
Poets Department, whereas songs from Midnights promoted astrophysics the most
throughout the Eras tour. We catagorize words into various disciplines of
astrophysics and find that multimessenger astronomy is promoted the most, both
in Swift's total discography and throughout the Eras tour. We perform Taylor
expansion and predict $12 \pm 5$ astrophysical terms in Swift's next album.
This analysis offers a unique perspective on the intersection of music and
science, revealing how Swift's artistry may unintentionally promote interest in
different fields of astrophysics.

Jerk plays a pivotal role in the thrilling experience of many amusemement
park rides. In addition to exploring the physical aspect of jerks, we tackle
the empirical observation of an attractive force between passengers in the
popular attraction, the spinning teacups. By modeling the complex system of
rotating platforms, we show that pseudotorques induced by changing acceleration
lead to jerky movements and an attractive interaction among riders. Our
numerical analysis confirms the empirical observations, highlighting the
connection between attraction and jerks.

We all love the ecstasy that comes with submitting papers to journals or
arXiv. Some have described it as yeeting their back-breaking products of labor
into the void, wishing they could never deal with them ever again. The very act
of yeeting papers onto arXiv contributes to the expansion of the arXiverse;
however, we have yet to quantify our contribution to the cause. In this work, I
investigate the expansion of the arXiverse using the arXiv astro-ph submission
data from 1992 to date. I coin the term "the arXiverse constant", $a_0$, to
quantify the rate of expansion of the arXiverse. I find that astro-ph as a
whole has a positive $a_0$, but this does not always hold true for the six
subcategories of astro-ph. I then investigate the temporal changes in $a_0$ for
the astro-ph subcategories and astro-ph as a whole, from which I infer the fate
of the arXiverse.

For generations, people have complained that things used to be better in the
past. In this paper, we investigate this change by specifically looking at
creativity in astronomy. To do this,we explore if older constellations
reflected a greater sense of creativity on the part of those designing them
than more modern constellations do. We find that things really have become
simplistic and less original over time.

Catsteroseismology, or asterocatsmology, is an unexplored area of
observational and theoretical research that proposes to use purr-mode
oscillations to study the much-beloved but poorly-understood species Felis
catus. In this work, we conduct a survey to measure fundamental purrameters of
cats and relate them to their purr-modes. Relations between these fundamental
cat purrameters, which include physical (eg. size, cuddliness) and personality
(eg. aggression, intelligence) traits, and purr-modes can help probe their
inner lives and emotions. We find that while purr characteristics tentatively
trend with several physical and personality traits, more data is required to
better constrain these relationships and infer the direct predictive power of
personality on purr-modes, or vice versa.

We present the first--ever example of a macroscopic system in a quantum
superposition. The system in question is a Siamese cat known as Lola; however,
on a time scale of about 12 hours it oscillates into a different state that we
refer to as "Mola". In the "Lola" state, the system is sweet and friendly and
allows to cuddle itself, but in the "Mola" state, it is malevolent and witchy.
When the probability of the system being in the "Mola" state is high,
decoherence is strongly discouraged!

In the big data era of Astrophysics, the improvement of visualization
techniques can greatly enhance the ability to identify and interpret key
features in complex datasets. This aspect of data analysis will become even
more relevant in the near future, with the expected growth of data volumes.
With our studies, we aim to drive progress in this field and inspire further
research. We present the second release of pastamarkers, a Python-based
matplotlib package that we initially presented last year. In this new release
we focus on big data visualization and update the content of our first release.
We find that analyzing complex problems and mining large data sets becomes
significantly more intuitive and engaging when using the familiar and
appetizing colors of pasta sauces instead of traditional colormaps.

We present a novel and somewhat whimsical approach to pulsar hotspot modeling
by drawing inspiration from the iconic one-eyed monster, Mike Wazowski, from
\emph{Monsters, Inc.}. Utilizing X-ray high-quality timing data from NICER, we
apply a Bayesian inference framework to model the X-ray pulse profile of PSR
J0437--4715. Our analysis employs a \emph{Wazowski Configuration} (WC) in which
the conventional hotspot parametrization is replaced with a predefined image
template, whose redness and size are adjusted to mimic temperature variations.
The results reveal a configuration where two hotspots--one brighter and smaller
in the north represents the energetic ``University time Wazowski", and one
larger yet cooler in the south represents the ``Monster, Inc. time
Wazowski"--combine to produce the observed X-ray pulse profile. These findings
not only demonstrate the sensitivity of pulse profile modeling to hotspot
morphology but also open up the intriguing possibility that the X-ray emission
of some pulsars may be interpreted as a cosmic homage to our favorite animated
character.

The cosmological principle posits that the universe does not exhibit any
specific preference for position or direction. However, it remains unclear
whether the universe has a distinct preference for parity: whether certain
properties are more likely to be classified as even or odd. In this study, we
analyze the largest available galaxy group catalogs to explore this hypothesis:
specifically, whether the number of galaxies within a galaxy group or cluster
is more likely to be odd or even. Our findings convincingly indicate that the
universe indeed favors odd numbers, with results achieving a significance level
well above the $4.1-\sigma$ threshold.

the arXiv.org experiment in the \texttt{hep-ph} channel, corresponding to a raw
total integrated $\mathcal{L}$iterature of 65,276 papers, we perform a search

detect ``New Physics'' with ``the LHC'' at a significance level of at least
$6.5\sigma$. This ``New Physics'' signature is primarily ``Dark'' in nature,
and is potentially axion(-like) dark matter. We also show the potential for
further improvement in the future, and that ``New Physics'' can be found with
``a Future Collider'' at at least $8.9\sigma$, as well as the potential to find
``New Physics'' without any collider at all. This search is performed using

Any permutation-invariant function of data points $\vec{r}_i$ can be written
in the form $\rho(\sum_i\phi(\vec{r}_i))$ for suitable functions $\rho$ and
$\phi$. This form - known in the machine-learning literature as Deep Sets -
also generates a map-reduce algorithm. The area of a triangle is a
permutation-invariant function of the locations $\vec{r}_i$ of the three
corners $1\leq i\leq 3$. We find the polynomial formula for the area of a
triangle that is explicitly in Deep Sets form. This project was motivated by
questions about the fundamental computational complexity of $n$-point
statistics in cosmology; that said, no insights of any kind were gained from

An outstanding mystery of dark matter physics is the lack of direct detection

experiments. This represents the first step in a broader theoretical paradigm

The number of planets in the solar system over the last three centuries has,
perhaps surprisingly, been less of a fixed value than one would think it should
be. In this paper, we look at the specific case of Vulcan, which was both a
planet before Pluto was a planet and discarded from being a planet before Pluto
was downgraded. We examine the historical context that led to its discovery in
the 19th century, the decades of observations that were taken of it, and its
eventual fall from glory. By applying a more modern understanding of
astrophysics, we provide multiple mechanisms that may have changed the orbit of
Vulcan sufficiently that it would have been outside the footprint of early 20th
century searches for it. Finally, we discuss how the April 8, 2024 eclipse
provides a renewed opportunity to rediscover this lost planet after more than a
century of having been overlooked.

In the seven years that the starship Voyager spent in the Delta Quadrant, it
used many questionable techniques to engage with alien civilizations and
ultimately find its way home. From detailed studies of their logs and opening
credits, we simulate Voyager's practice of orbiting a planet, to examine the
effect on planetary rings. We outline a feasible planetary system and simulate
the extent to which its rings would be disrupted. We find that Voyager's orbit
could inflate the height of the rings in the vicinity of the spacecraft by a
factor of 2, as well as increase the relative speeds of neighboring
planetesimals within the rings. This increase in ring thickness has the
potential to alter shadows on any moons of this planet, impacting ring-shadow
based religions. Additionally, the acceleration of these planetesimals could
rival their gravity, bucking any alien inhabitants and their tiny civilizations
off of their planetesimal homeworlds. Finally, we posit that due to increased
collisions amongst the planetesimals (which may harbor tiny intelligent life)
the trajectory of these civilizations may be forever altered, violating the
prime directive.

Over the past decade, exoplanet atmospheric characterization has became what
some might call the cosmology of astronomy. In an attempt to extract and
understand the weak planetary signals (a few percent down to a few tens of ppm
times that of their host-star signals), researchers have developed dozens of
idealized planetary atmospheric models. Physical interpretations hinge on
pretending that we understand stellar signals (as well behaved mostly
temporarily static spherical cows), as well as planetary signals (as
unidimensional objects, or sometimes quasi-multidimensional objects). The
discovery of small and cool planets has lead to analyze planetary signals well
below the designed photometric precision of current instrumentation. The
challenge is up there, and keep us busy, so all is well. Here we present yet
another open-source tool to analyze exoplanet data of time-series observations.

Recently, cosmology has seen a surge in alternative models that purport to
solve the discrepancy between the values of the Hubble constant $H_0$ as
measured by cosmological microwave background anisotropies and local
supernovae, respectively. In particular, many of the most successful approaches
have involved varying fundamental constants, such as an alternative value of
the fine structure constant and time-varying values of the electron mass, the
latter of which showed particular promise as the strongest candidate in several
earlier studies. Inspired by these approaches, in this paper, we investigate a
cosmological model where the value of the geometric constant $\pi$ is taken to
be a free model parameter. Using the latest CMB data from Planck as well as
baryon-acoustic oscillation data, we constrain the parameters of the model and
find a strong correlation between $\pi$ and $H_0$, with the final constraint
$H_0 = 71.3 \pm 1.1 \ \mathrm{ km/s/Mpc}$, equivalent to a mere $1.5\sigma$
discrepancy with the value measured by the SH0ES collaboration. Furthermore,
our results show that $\pi = 3.206 \pm 0.038$ at $95 \%$ C.L., which is in good
agreement with several external measurements discussed in the paper. Hence, we
conclude that the $\pi \Lambda$CDM model presented in this paper, which has
only a single extra parameter, currently stands as the perhaps strongest
solution to the Hubble tension.

A Total Solar Eclipse (TSE) is a shocking and sublime experience. In just a
week hundreds of millions of Homo Sapiens will attempt to see the 2024 eclipse
as it stretches across the North American continent. However, while Homo
Sapiens may be uniquely positioned to understand and predict eclipses, they are
not the only species capable of observing them. The precise alignment of the
Moon, Earth and Sun all existed well before humans. In the same way we share
this planet capable of hosting life, the fantastic astronomical experiences
available on it are not exclusive either. We present a framework to calculate
the number of Total Solar Eclipses experienced by a species at any point in
Earth's history. This includes factoring in the evolution of the Sun-Moon-Earth
system, the duration the species is extant, and average population. We
normalize over the geographic range by calculating an Astronomical World
Eclipse Surface cOverage MEtric (AWESOME) time. To illustrate this framework we
look at the case study of the family Limulidae (Horseshoe Crabs) and estimate
the number of individuals that have seen an eclipse. We compare it to the
number of current Homo Sapiens that view eclipses, and predict if it is
possible for another species to take the ''top'' spot before the final total
solar eclipse in ~ 380 million years.

In recent years the James Webb Space Telescope has enabled the frontier of
observational galaxy formation to push to ever higher redshift, deep within
cosmic dawn. However, what is high-redshift, and when was cosmic dawn? While
widely used, these terms (as well as many other confusing terms) are not
consistently defined in the literature; this both hampers effective
communication but also impedes our ability to precisely characterize and
understand the phenomena under investigation. In this article we seek to
address this issue of utmost importance. We begin by definitively defining
terms such as ``high-redshift'', ``cosmic dawn'', etc. However, despite the
rigorous definitions for them we present, both the adjective-based redshift and
diurnal marker (time-of-day) division schemes suffer from issues including not
being sufficiently granular, angering cosmologists, being arbitrary, and having
a geocentric bias. To overcome these we introduce the \textit{redshiFt epOchs
fOr everyboDy} (FOOD) framework, a revolutionary new division scheme based on
eating occasions, i.e. meals.

The cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation offers a unique avenue for
exploring the early Universe's dynamics and evolution. In this paper, we delve
into the fascinating realm of slow-roll inflation, contextualizing the
primordial acoustic perturbations as the resonant echoes akin to the iconic
sound of Chewbacca from the Star Wars universe. By extrapolating polynomial
potentials for these primordial sounds, we illuminate their role in shaping the
inflationary landscape. Leveraging this framework, we calculate the scalar
spectral index ($n_s$) and tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$), providing insights
into the underlying physics governing the inflationary epoch. Employing a
rigorous chi-square ($\chi^2$) analysis, we meticulously scrutinize the Planck
data combined with that offered by the BICEP/Keck collaboration to identify the
Chewbacca sound profile that best aligns with observational constraints. Our
findings not only shed light on the intricate interplay between sound and
cosmology but also unveil intriguing parallels between the cosmic symphony of
the early universe and beloved cultural icons.

The Arago spot is an intensity maximum at the center of a shadow created by
constructive interference of diffracted waves around a spherical object. While
the study of diffraction patterns usually concerns visible light, de Broglie's
wave nature of matter makes diffraction theory applicable for particles, such
as neutrinos, as well. During a solar eclipse, some of the neutrinos emitted by
the Sun are diffracted by the Moon, resulting in a diffraction pattern that can
be observed on Earth. In this paper we consider the theoretically emerging
solar neutrino Arago spot as a means to measure the location of the Moon with
high accuracy and consider its implication on the orbit of the Moon given
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Our results indicate that the Moon is not
at immediate risk of orbital decoupling due to the observation of a solar
neutrino Arago spot.

This paper argues why FLAMINGO (Fast Light Atmospheric Monitoring and Imaging
Novel Gamma-ray Observatory) is the perfect name for an array of
very-high-energy Cherenkov telescopes. Studies which indicate pink is the most
suitable pigment for the structures of Cherenkov telescopes have passed with
flying colors. Pink optimizes the absorption and reflectivity properties of the
telescopes with respect to the characteristic blue color of the Cherenkov
radiation emitted by high-energy particles in the atmosphere. In addition to
giving the sensitivity a big leg up, a pink color scheme also adds a unique and
visually appealing aspect to the project's branding and outreach efforts.
FLAMINGO has a fun and memorable quality that can help to increase public
engagement and interest in astrophysics and also help to promote diversity in
the field with its colorful nature. In an era of increasingly unpronounceable
scientific acronyms, we are putting our foot down. FLAMINGO is particularly
fitting, as flamingos have eyesight optimized to detect small particles,
aligning with the primary purpose of Cherenkov telescopes to detect faint
signals from air showers. We should not wait in the wings just wishing for new
name to come along: in FLAMINGO we have an acronym that both accurately
reflects the science behind Cherenkov telescopes and provides a visually
striking identity for the project. While such a sea change will be no easy
feet, we are glad to stick our necks out and try: FLAMINGO captures the essence
of what an array of Cherenkov telescopes represents and can help to promote the
science to a wider audience. We aim to create an experiment and brand that
people from all walks of life will flock to.

We argue that the reported cases of Spontaneous Human Combustion (SHC) are
most likely due to the impact of the human body with an extremely high energy
particle like cosmic rays or Dark Matter. Normal and antimatter cosmic rays and
classical weakly-interacting massive particles (WIMPs) with energies of GeV to
ZeV can be easily ruled out due to their inability to dump enough energy into a
small region of human tissue, leaving as the single remaining candidate massive
Dark Matter particles. While primordial Black Holes would appear to be very
good candidates for inducing the SHC phenomenon, we show that the estimated
local Dark Matter density requires that the particles have masses of $\sim
10$\,kg, clearly ruling out this candidate. All of the other classic DM
candidates -- from scalar and pseudo-scalar spin 1/2 and spin 2 gauge singlets
to nuclearitic strange quark ``bowling balls'' -- can be ruled out. Axions
tailored to solve the CP-problem also cannot be invoked, no matter what mass is
considered. The only particles left are massive mega-axions (MaMAs), for which
there are an infinite number of possible string models.

Earth, and at the same time evolved the orbit of the Moon, and therefore the
length of a Lunar month. Using a subset of this data and referencing literature
models of the Moon's orbital evolution, we create our own simple model to
determine "True Happy New Years", time periods when there were an integer
number of lunar synodic months in an Earth orbital year. This would allow
modern calendars to pick a shared New Year's Day, and party accordingly. We
then predict the next True Happy New Year to be in 252 million years, and offer
suggestions to begin the party planning process early, so that we as a planet
may be ready.

How many gravitational-wave observations from compact object mergers have we
seen to date? This seemingly simple question has a surprisingly complex answer
that even ChatGPT struggles to answer. To shed light on this, we present a
database with the literature's answers to this question. We find values
spanning 67-100 for the number of detections from double compact object mergers
to date, emphasizing that the exact number of detections is uncertain and
depends on the chosen data analysis pipeline and underlying assumptions. We
also review the number of gravitational-wave detections expected in the coming
decades with future observing runs, finding values up to millions of detections
per year in the era of Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope. We present a
publicly available code to visualize the detection numbers, highlighting the
exponential growth in gravitational-wave observations in the coming decades and
the exciting prospects of gravitational-wave astrophysics. See
http://www.broekgaarden.nl/floor/wordpress/elementor-967/. We plan to keep this
database up-to-date and welcome comments and suggestions for additional

The lower limit on the chicken density function (CDF) of the observable
Universe was recently determined to be approximately 10$^{-21}$ chickens
pc$^{-3}$. For over a year, however, the scientific community has struggled to
determine the upper limit to the CDF. Here we aim to determine a reasonable
upper limit to the CDF using multiple observational constraints. We take a
holistic approach to considering the effects of a high CDF in various domains,
including the Solar System, interstellar medium, and effects on the cosmic
microwave background. We find the most restrictive upper limit from the domains
considered to be 10$^{23}$ pc$^{-3}$, which ruffles the feathers of

I employ an optimization-based inference methodology together with an Ising
model, in an intentionally ineffectual manner, to get away with murdering an
obstreperous scientific collaborator. The antics of this collaborator,
hereafter "Conan O'Brien," were impeding the publication of an important
manuscript. With my tenure date looming, I found myself desperate. Luckily, I
study inference, a computational means to find a solution to a physical
problem, based on available measurements (say, a dead body) and a dynamical
model assumed to give rise to those measurements (a murderer). If the
measurements are insufficient and/or the model is incomplete, one obtains
multiple "degenerate" solutions to the problem. Degenerate solutions are all
equally valid given the information available, and thus render meaningless the
notion of one "correct" solution. Typically in scientific research, degeneracy
is undesirable. Here I describe the opposite situation: a quest to create
degenerate solutions in which to cloak myself. Or even better: to render
measurements incompatible with a solution in which I am the murderer. Moreover,
I show how one may sabotage an inference procedure to commit an untraceable
crime. I sit here now, typing victoriously, a free woman. Because you won't
believe me anyway. And even if you do, you'll never prove a thing.

that "galaxy" formation, dark matter, and the tension in the expansion of the
universe can all be explained by the natural behaviors of an overwhelmingly
large population of exoplanets throughout the universe. Some of these ideas
have started to be proposed in the literature, and we commend these pioneers
revolutionizing our understanding of astrophysics. Furthermore, we assert that,
since planets are obviously the ubiquitous answer to every current question
that can be posed by astronomers, planetary science must then be the basis for
all science, and therefore that all current funding for science be reserved for
(exo)planetary science - we happily welcome all astronomers and other

The search for exoplanets has become a focal point of astronomical research,
captivating public attention and driving scientific inquiry; however, the rush
to confirm exoplanet discoveries has often overlooked potential alternative
explanations leading to a scientific consensus that is overly reliant on
untested assumptions and limited data. We argue that the evidence in support of
exoplanet observation is not necessarily definitive and that alternative
interpretations are not only possible, but necessary. Our conclusion is
therefore concise: exoplanets do not exist. Here, we present the framework for
a novel type of cuboid star, or squar, which can precisely reproduce the full
range of observed phenomena in stellar light curves, including the trapezoidal
flux deviations (TFDs) often attributed to "exoplanets." In this discovery
paper, we illustrate the power of the squellar model, showing that the light
curve of the well-studied "exoplanet" WASP-12b can be reconstructed simply from
a rotating squar with proportions $1:1/8:1$, without invoking ad-hoc planetary
bodies. Our findings cast serious doubt on the validity of current
"exoplanetary" efforts, which have largely ignored the potential role of squars
and have instead blindly accepted the exoplanet hypothesis without sufficient
critical scrutiny. In addition, we discuss the sociopolitical role of climate
change in spurring the current exoplanet fervor which has lead to the
speculative state of "exoplanetary science" today. We strongly urge the
astronomical community to take our model proposal seriously and treat its
severe ramifications with the utmost urgency to restore rationality to the
field of astronomy.

With the proliferation of online Zoom meetings as a means of doing science in
the 2020s, astronomers have made new and unexpected Target of Opportunity (ToO)
observations. Chief among these ToOs are observations of exop(lan)ets, or
"exopets." Building on the work of Mayorga et al. (2021) - whose work
characterized the rotational variations of "floofy" objects - we model exopets
using methods similar to those used for exoplanetary transits. We present data
collected for such exopet Zoom transits through a citizen science program in
the month of February 2022. The dataset includes parameters like exopet color,
floofiness, transit duration, and percentage of Zoom screen covered during the
event. For some targets, we also present microlensing and direct imaging data.
Using results from our modelling of 62 exopet observations as transits,
microlensing, and direct imaging events, we discuss our inferences of exopet
characteristics like their masses, sizes, orbits, colors, and floofiness.

I present for your appraisal three independent cases of the manuscript
referee process conducted by a venerable peer-reviewed scientific journal. Each
case involves a little pig, who submitted for consideration a theoretical plan
for a house to be constructed presently, in a faraway land. An anonymous big
bad wolf was assigned by the journal to assess the merit of these manuscripts.
The pigs proposed three distinct construction frameworks, which varied in
physical and mathematical sophistication. The first little pig submitted a
model of straw, based on the numerical method of toe-counting. His design
included odd features, such as spilled millet and cloven-hoofprints on the
window sill -- possibly a ploy to distract the wolf from the manuscript's
facile mathematical foundation. The second little pig used a more advanced
approach, employing Newton's classical laws of motion, to propose a house of
sticks. This pig included in her manuscript copious citations by a specific
wolf, possibly aiming to ensure acceptance by flattering the wolf whom she
anticipated would be the referee. The third little pig described an
ostentatious house of bricks based on an elaborate dynamical systems and
stability analysis, possibly scheming to dazzle and impress. The big bad wolf
did not appear moved by any of the pigs' tactics. His recommendations were, for
straw: the minor revision of water-proofing; for sticks: the major revision of
fire-proofing, given concerns surrounding climate change; for bricks:
unequivocal rejection, accompanied by multiple derogatory comments regarding
"high-and-mighty theorists." I describe each case in detail, and suggest that
the wolf's reports might be driven as much by self interest as the manuscripts
themselves -- namely, that at the time the wolf wrote the reviews, he was
rather hungry. Finally, I examine morals learned, if any.

It has previously been suggested that the rate of exoplanet discovery,
doubling roughly every 39 months, is indicative of a runaway increase in the
number of exoplanets in our galaxy. In this paper, we posit that - due to the
finite nature of space in the milky way - it will become increasingly likely
that one of these exoplanets will be found within our solar system. We
calculate the odds of this occurring pass 50\% on Friday 9th December 2146. We
go on to suggest novel methods for influencing where this exoplanet may be
discovered, note possible drawbacks of the discovery, and finally explore how
the previously-hypothesized `exoplanet singularity' (both figurative and

Though it may be a behavior that has been observed and documented for
millennia, and despite the connection between it and the full moon, the
astronomical community has afforded very little attention to lycanthropy. We
hope to address this deficiency by using the population of known exoplanets as
a natural experiment to better characterize what properties of the moon are
necessary to trigger a transformation into a werewolf. We additionally
investigate which exoplanets are most likely to have exomoons which may cause
werewolves, with a particular focus on LHS 1140 b. We also propose a new
mission called the Werewolves From Infrared Radiation and Spectral-typing
Telescope, or WFIRST, in order to better characterize exoplanetary systems.
This will allow us to explore the impact of stellar type on lycanthropy more

exocryptozoology.

$\textit{The Bachelor}$ is a reality TV dating show in which a single
bachelor selects his wife from a pool of approximately 30 female contestants
over eight weeks of filming (American Broadcasting Company 2002). We collected
the following data on all 422 contestants that participated in seasons 11
through 25: their Age, Hometown, Career, Race, Week they got their first 1-on-1
date, whether they got the first impression rose, and what "place" they ended
up getting. We then trained three machine learning models to predict the ideal
characteristics of a successful contestant on $\textit{The Bachelor}$. The
three algorithms that we tested were: random forest classification, neural
networks, and linear regression. We found consistency across all three models,
although the neural network performed the best overall. Our models found that a
woman has the highest probability of progressing far on $\textit{The Bachelor}$
if she is: 26 years old, white, from the Northwest, works as an dancer,
received a 1-on-1 in week 6, and did not receive the First Impression Rose. Our
methodology is broadly applicable to all romantic reality television, and our
results will inform future $\textit{The Bachelor}$ production and contestant
strategies. While our models were relatively successful, we still encountered
high misclassification rates. This may be because: (1) Our training dataset had
fewer than 400 points or (2) Our models were too simple to parameterize the
complex romantic connections contestants forge over the course of a season.

Caffeine may not be the only key. HL Tau, Taurus, bull... Taurine! We grinded
some red bourbon for a new pour-over, and developed the new,
coffee-groundsbreaking Large Astrocomical Taurine Tester Experiment (LATTE) in
just 1/4 of a day. We felt bull-ish about our chances of making a great
discovery! We installed LATTE, aimed it at the well-known young star HL Tau,
and there it was: an abundance of taurine gas beautifully outlining a cup of
cosmic flat white, with the ring structure of HL Tau turning out to be latte
art performed by a skillful cosmic barista. The first Robusta discovery of
coffee in space. Speaking of coffee, we hope you have a nice hot cup with you,

The statistical physics of phase transitions has been hugely successful at
describing numerous natural, physical, and technological phenomena, and now a
rigorous examination of the phase space of the culinary regime is likewise ripe
for the picking. Despite great demand for the resolution of many scientific
debates over the taxonomy of food, past attempts have failed to account for
complex phase behavior and co-existence, and have thus left the public hungry
for a more substantial theory. By applying the principles of statistical
physics and thermodynamics, we here map out the complete phase space of all
culinary dishes and find three distinct phase regimes: Soup, Salad, and
Sandwich. We consider the effect of different state variables on these phase
boundaries, as well as regions of co-existence and triple points. With this
complete 3-dimensional phase diagram of all foods, we can conclusively answer
many bitter debates, including the imperishable question "is a hotdog a
sandwich?" The answer: yes.

Dark matter models can be classified according to their impact on the
properties of galaxies, including cold dark matter (CDM), warm dark matter
(WDM), self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) and fuzzy dark matter (FDM). In
celebration of April Fool's Day, and also of the 1-year anniversary of the
start of the 2022 volcanic eruption at Fagradalsfjall here in Iceland, we
explore fresh lava as a candidate for WDM specifically. We verify first hand
that lava is indeed warm (exhibits free-streaming and retains temperature for
several months after the eruption ends, is 1000K, sets fire to grass, can feel
one's eyebrows singe at a distance of 4m) and dark once sufficiently decoupled

Using sedimentary and eclipse-based measurements of the lunar recession
velocity, we derive a new local-Universe measurement of the Hubble constant
($H_0$) from the recession rate of Earth's Moon. Taking into account the
effects of tides, we find a value of $H_{0}$ = 63.01 $\pm$ 1.79 km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$, which is in approximate agreement with the Planck space mission's
measurement using the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and base $\Lambda$CDM.
Our new measurement represents the first ever model-independent, single-step
measurement of the Universe's current expansion rate. This is also the first
major local Universe measurement of $H_0$ which is below the measurement from
Planck. Importantly, it is robust to the systematic errors that may be present
in other $H_0$ measurements using other cosmological probes such as type Ia
supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, or lensed quasars. Our work provides
key evidence towards the notion that the existing Hubble tension may indeed be
a result of systematic uncertainties in the local distance ladder.

The digital age has sparked a revival in the use of "dark mode" (DM) design
in many everyday applications as well as text editors and integrated developer
environments. We present the case for adding a DM theme to astronomical
journals, including a modified class file that generates the theme you see here
as a potential option. DM themes have many beneficial attributes to a user such
as saving battery power and reducing screen burn-in on devices with OLED
screens, increasing figure hopping efficiency, pairing well with
colorblind-friendly palettes, and limiting rhodopsin loss while observing. We
analyzed iPoster design trends from AAS 237 and 238 to gauge the possible
reception of our DM theme, and we estimate that at least 35%, but likely closer
to 42%, of the community would welcome this addition to journals. There are
some drawbacks to using a DM theme when reading papers, including increased ink
usage when reading in a print medium and some diminished legibility and
comprehension in low-light conditions. While these issues are not negligible,
we believe they can be mitigated, especially with a paired submission of both a
DM and traditional, "light mode" manuscript. It is also likely that many of us
will become better astronomers as a result of adding DM to journals.

The last 25 years have been revolutionary in astronomy, as the field of
exoplanets has gone from no known planets outside the Solar System to thousands
discovered over the last year few years. This represents a rapid increase not
just in known planets (often referred to as Mamajek's Law), but also in total
planetary mass. What has been heretofore unaddressed, however, is that this
rapid increase in planetary masses may have disastrous consequences for the
future of humanity. We look at how the number of planets, and more importantly,
the mass of these planets has changed in the past and how we can expect this to
change in the future. The answers to those questions, and how we respond to
them, will determine if humanity is able to survive beyond the next 230 years.

My cat Chester investigates the elusive relationship between the appearance
in my hand of a silver laser pointer and that of a red dot on the wall, or on
the floor, or on any other object that resides within the vicinity of the laser
pointer. Chester first assesses preliminary establishments for causality,
including mutual information, temporal precedence, and control for third
variables. These assessments are all inconclusive for various reasons. In
particular, mutual information fails to illuminate the problem due to a dearth
of information regarding what the laser pointer might have been doing at times
following Chester's first awareness of the dot. Next Chester performs a formal
reconstruction of phase space via time-delay embedding, to unfold the
gggggggggggfffgfgtredvteometry
,mmmm.........,.,,......,.mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm of the
underlying dynamical system giving rise to the red dot's trajectory. The
resulting attractor does not resemble a laser pointer. The reconstruction
could, however, be flawed, for example, due to the short temporal duration of
the dot's observed trajectory. Finally, the red dot could be a hallucination: a
symptom brought on by COVID-19 - because, well, these days pretty much anything
might be a symptom brought on by COVID-19. On this note, Chester's kitten

As a modern musician and cultural icon, Taylor Swift has earned worldwide
acclaim via pieces which predominantly draw upon the complex dynamics of
personal and interpersonal experiences. Here we show, for the first time, how
Swift's lyrical and melodic structure have evolved in their representation of
emotions over a timescale of $\tau\sim14$ yr. Previous progress on this topic
has been challenging based on the sheer volume of the relevant discography, and
that uniquely identifying a song that optimally describes a hypothetical
emotional state represents a multi-dimensional and complex task. To quantify
the emotional state of a song, we separate the criteria into the level of
optimism ($H$) and the strength of commitment to a relationship ($R$), based on
lyrics and chordal tones. We apply these criteria to a set of 149 pieces
spanning almost the entire repertoire. We find an overall trend toward positive
emotions in stronger relationships, with a best-fit linear relationship of
$R=0.642^{+0.086}_{-0.053}H-1.74^{+0.39}_{-0.29}$. We find no significant
trends in mean happiness ($H$) within individual albums over time. The mean
relationship score ($R$) shows trends which we speculate may be due to age and
the global pandemic. We provide tentative indications that partners with blue
eyes and/or bad reputations may lead to overall less positive emotions, while
those with green or indigo-colored eyes may produce more positive emotions and
stronger relationships. However, we stress that these trends are based on small
sample sizes, and more data are necessary to validate them. Finally, we present
the taylorswift python package which can be used to optimize song selection
according to a specific mood.

Phase resolved observations of planetary bodies allow us to understand the
longitudinal and latitudinal variations that make each one unique. Rotational
variations have been detected in several types of astronomical bodies beyond
those of planetary mass, including asteroids, brown dwarfs, and stars.
Unexpected rotational variations, such as those presented in this work, reminds
us that the universe can be complicated, with more mysteries to uncover. In
this work we present evidence for a new class of astronomical objects we
identify as "floofy" with observational distinctions between several sub-types
of these poorly understood objects. Using optical observations contributed by
the community, we have identified rotational variation in several of these
floofy objects, which suggests that they may have strong differences between
their hemispheres, likely caused by differing reflectivity off their surfaces.
Additional sub-types show no rotational variability suggesting a uniform
distribution of reflective elements on the floofy object. While the work here
is a promising step towards the categorization of floofy objects, further
observations with more strictly defined limits on background light,
illumination angles, and companion objects are necessary to develop a better
understanding of the many remaining mysteries of these astronomical objects.

I conjecture an upper bound on the number of possible swampland conjectures
by comparing the entropy required by the conjectures themselves to the
Beckenstein-Hawking entropy of the cosmological horizon. Assuming of order 100
kilobits of entropy per conjecture, this places an upper bound of order
$10^{117}$ on the number of conjectures. I estimate the rate of production of
swampland conjectures by the number of papers listed on INSPIRE with the word
"swampland" in the title or abstract, which has been showing approximately
exponential growth since 2014. At the current rate of growth, the entropy bound
on the number of swampland conjectures can be projected to be saturated on a
timescale of order $10^{-8} H_0^{-1}$. I compare the upper bound from the
Swampland Conjecture Bound Conjecture (SCBC) to the estimated number of vacua
in the string landscape. Employing the duality suggested by AdS/CFT between the
quantum complexity of a holographic state and the volume of a Wheeler-Dewitt
spacetime patch, I place a conservative lower bound of order $\mathcal{N}_H >
10^{263}$ on the number of Hubble volumes in the multiverse which must be
driven to heat death to fully explore the string landscape via conjectural
methods.

harden rather than soften on becoming stale) suggest that they are in fact
cake. In order to finally put this debate to rest, we re-purpose technologies
used to classify transient events. We train two classifiers (a Random Forest
and a Support Vector Machine) on 100 recipes of traditional cakes and biscuits.
Our classifiers have 95 percent and 91 percent accuracy respectively. Finally
we feed two Jaffa Cake recipes to the algorithms and find that Jaffa Cakes are,

We propose a novel mechanism for the production of dark matter (DM) from a
thermal bath, based on the idea that DM particles $\chi$ can transform heat
bath particles $\psi$: $\chi \psi \rightarrow \chi \chi$. For a small initial
abundance of $\chi$ this leads to an exponential growth of the DM number
density, in close analogy to other familiar exponential growth processes in
nature. We demonstrate that this mechanism complements freeze-in and freeze-out
production in a generic way, opening new parameter space to explain the
observed DM abundance, and we discuss observational prospects for such
scenarios.

We employ simulated annealing to identify the global solution of a dynamical
model, to make a favorable impression upon colleagues at the departmental
holiday party and then exit undetected as soon as possible. The procedure,
Gradual Freeze-out of an Optimal Estimation via Optimization of Parameter
Quantification - GFOOEOPQ, is designed for the socially awkward. The socially
awkward among us possess little instinct for pulling off such a maneuver, and
may benefit from a machine to do it for us. The method rests upon Bayes'
Theorem, where the probability of a future model state depends on current
knowledge of the model. Here, model state vectors are party attendees, and the
future event of interest is their disposition toward us at times following the
party. We want these dispositions to be favorable. To this end, we first
interact so as to make favorable impressions, or at least ensure that these
people remember having seen us there. Then we identify the exit that minimizes
the chance that anyone notes how early we high-tailed it. Now, poorly-resolved
estimates will correspond to degenerate solutions. As noted, we possess no
instinct to identify a global optimum by ourselves. This can have disastrous
consequences. For this reason, GFOOEOPQ employs annealing to iteratively home
in on this optimum. The method is illustrated via a simulated event hosted by
someone in the physics department (I am not sure who), in a two-bedroom
apartment on the fifth floor of an elevator building in Manhattan, with viable
Exit parameters: front door, side door to a stairwell, fire escape, and a
bathroom window that opens onto the fire escape. Preliminary tests are reported
at two real social celebrations. The procedure is generalizable to corporate
events and family gatherings. Readers are encouraged to report novel
applications of GFOOEOPQ, to expand the algorithm.

Exploring the Universe is one of the great unifying themes of humanity. Part
of this endeavour is the search for extraterrestrial life. But how likely is it
that we will find life, or that if we do it will be similar to ourselves? And
therefore how do we know where and how to look? We give examples of the sort of
reasoning that has been used to narrow and focus this search and we argue that
obvious extensions to that logical framework will result in greater success.

A mission to the focus of the solar gravitational lens could produce images
with unprecedented angular resolution and sensitivity. In the context of trying
to resolve the time variable thermal signature of continents on other
Earth-like exoplanets, we develop an approach to improve the image
reconstruction performance by using azimuthal variations in the Einstein Ring's
intensity. In the first post-Newtonian approximation to General Relativity, an
arbitrary disk intensity distribution in the source plane is mapped to a narrow
annulus around the Einstein Ring, with each azimuthal element corresponding to
a sector in the disk. A matrix-based linear measurement model at various fixed
signal-to-noise ratios demonstrates that this extra information is useful in
improving the reconstruction when the image is sparsely sampled, which could
improve integration times and temporal errors. Various issues and future
outlooks are discussed.

Since the discovery of the first confirmed exoplanet, observations have
revealed a remarkable diversity of worlds. A wide variety of orbital and
physical characteristics are detected in the exoplanet population, and much
work has been devoted to deciding which of these planets may be suitable for
life. Until now, though, little work has been devoted to deciding which of the
potentially habitable planets might actually be \textit{worth} existing on. To
this end, we present the Really Habitable Zone (RHZ), defined as the region
around a star where acceptable gins and tonic are likely to be abundant. In
common with much of the work in the field, we rely throughout on assumptions
which are difficult if not impossible to test and present some plots which
astronomers can use in their own talks, stripped of all caveats. We suggest
that planets in the Really Habitable Zone be early targets for the JWST,
because by the time that thing finally launches we're all going to need a
drink.

Godwin's law, i.e. the empirical observation that as an online discussion
grows in time, the probability of a comparison with Nazis or Hitler quickly
approaches unity, is one of the best-documented facts of the internet.
Anticipating the quantum internet, here we show under reasonable model
assumptions a polynomial quantum speedup of Godwin's law. Concretely, in
quantum discussions, Hitler will be mentioned on average quadratically earlier,
and we conjecture that under specific network topologies, even cubic speedups
are possible. We also show that the speedup cannot be more than exponential,
unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to a certain finite level. We report
on numerical experiments to simulate the appearance of the quantum Godwin law
in future quantum internets; the most amazing finding of our studies is that --
unlike quantum computational speedups -- the quantum Godwin effect is not only
robust against noise, but actually enhanced by decoherence. We have as yet no
theoretical explanation, nor a good application, for this astonishing
behaviour, which we dub quantum hyperpiesia.

Evidence has continued to accumulate over the last few decades as to the
existence and nature of dark matter. Depending on the particle candidate, the
dark matter can exhibit one of several cosmologically defined models: hot dark
matter, cold dark matter, warm dark matter, self-interacting dark matter, and
fuzzy dark matter. In this paper I review the relevance and status of these
models, whether it is possible for more than one of these models to each
constitute some fraction of the dark matter, and discuss the prospects for
determining if any of these models can successfully describe the properties and
evolution of our own Universe.

the boundary between the landscape of consistent low-energy limits of quantum
gravity, and the swampland of theories that cannot be embedded within string
theory because they violate certain trendy and obviously uncontroversial
conjectures. The Marshland is probably fractal, and we show some pretty
pictures of fractals that will be useful in talks. We further show that the
Marshland contains theories with a large number of light axions, allowing us to
cite lots of our own papers. We show that the Marshland makes up most of the

Despite a previous description of his state as a stable fixed point, just
past midnight this morning Mr. Boddy was murdered again. In fact, over 70 years
Mr. Boddy has been reported murdered $10^6$ times, while there exist no
documented attempts at intervention. Using variational data assimilation, we
train a model of Mr. Boddy's dynamics on the time series of observed murders,
to forecast future murders. The parameters to be estimated include instrument,
location, and murderer. We find that a successful estimation requires three
additional elements. First, to minimize the effects of selection bias, generous
ranges are placed on parameter searches, permitting values such as the Cliff,
the Poisoned Apple, and the Wife. Second, motive, which was not considered
relevant to previous murders, is added as a parameter. Third, Mr. Boddy's
little-known asthmatic condition is considered as an alternative cause of
death. Following this morning's event, the next local murder is forecast for
17:19:03 EDT this afternoon, with a standard deviation of seven hours, at The
Kitchen at 4330 Katonah Avenue, Bronx, NY, 10470, with either the Lead Pipe or
the Lead Bust of Washington Irving. The motive is: Case of Mistaken Identity,
and there was no convergence upon a murderer. Testing of the procedure's
predictive power will involve catching the D train to 205th Street and a few
transfers over to Katonah Avenue, and sitting around waiting with our eyes
peeled. We discuss the problem of identifying a global solution - that is, the
best reason for murder on a landscape riddled with pretty-decent reasons. We
also discuss the procedure's assumption of Gaussian-distributed errors, which
will under-predict rare events. This under-representation of highly improbable
events may be offset by the fact that the training data, after all, consists of
multiple murders of a single person.

Many previous authors have attempted to find explanations for Westeros's
climate, characterized by a generally moderate, Earth-like climate punctuated
by extremely long and cold winters, separated by thousands of years. One
explanation that has been proposed is that the planet orbits in a Sitnikov
configuration, where two equal-mass stars (or a star and a black hole) orbit
each other on slightly eccentric orbits, and the planet moves along a line
through the barycenter perpendicular to the primaries' orbital plane
(Freistetter & Gr\"utzbauch 2018). We modify an intermediate-complexity GCM to
include the effects of such an orbit and integrate it for thousands of years to
determine whether such an orbit can a) be habitable and b) explain the climatic
variations observed by the inhabitants of Westeros, in both double-star and
star-black hole configurations. While configurations with low primary
eccentricity and initial conditions that permit only small excursions from the
ecliptic plane are habitable, these orbits are too stable to explain Westerosi
climate. We find that while orbits with more bounded chaos are able to produce
rare anomalously long and cold winters similar to Westeros's Long Night, huge
variations in incident stellar flux on normal orbital timescales should render
these planets uninhabitable. We note that the presence of an orbital
megastructure, either around the planet or the barycenter, could block some of
the sunlight during crossings of the primaries' orbital plane and preserve
Westeros's habitability. While we find that bounded chaotic Sitnikov orbits are
a viable explanation for Westeros's Long Night, we propose that chaotic
variations of the planet's axial tilt or semimajor axis, potentially due to
torques from nearby planets or stars, may be a more realistic explanation than
Sitnikov orbits.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are, as the name implies, short and intense pulses
of radiation at wavelengths of roughly one metre. FRBs have extremely high
brightness temperatures, which points to a coherent source of radiation. The
energy of a single burst ranges from $10^{36}$ to $10^{39}$ erg. At the high
end of the energy range, FRBs have enough energy to unbind an earth-sized
planet, and even at the low end, there is enough energy to vaporise and unbind
the atmosphere and the oceans. We therefore propose that FRBs are signatures of
an artificial terraformer, capable of eradicating life on another planet, or
even destroy the planet entirely. The necessary energy can be harvested from
Wolf-Rayet stars with a Dyson sphere ($\sim 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$) , and the
radiation can be readily produced by astrophysical masers. We refer to this
mechanism as Volatile Amplification of a Destructive Emission of Radiation
(VADER). We use the observational information to constrain the properties of
the apparatus. We speculate that the non-repeating FRBs are low-energy pulses
used to exterminate life on a single planet, but leaving it otherwise intact,
and that the stronger repeating FRB is part of an effort to destroy multiple
objects in the same solar system, perhaps as a preventative measure against
panspermia. In this picture, the persistent synchrotron source associated with
the first repeating FRB arises from the energy harvesting process. Finally we
propose that Oumuamua might have resulted from a destruction of a planet in
this manner.

With the wealth of planets that have been discovered over the past $\sim$ 20
years, the field can broadly be divided into two regimes. For understanding
broad occurrence and formation rates, large numbers of planets allow for
population statistics to be calculated, and this work preferentially tends
towards fainter planets (and fainter host stars) to allow for a large number of
detections. The second regime is the detailed understanding of a single planet,
with particular consideration to planetary structure and atmosphere, and in
this case benefits from finding individual planets (and host stars) that are
very close, and subsequently, very bright. The closest of these also provide
very novel possibilities for exploration if they are close enough that travel
time to them is relatively low, something that would be extremely unlikely for
more distant planets. Here, we announce the independent discovery of a
sub-earth planet orbiting in the habitable zone of a very close solar-mass star
using a novel processing technique and observations from the Kilodegree

The natives of Westeros have failed to develop a feasible model to understand

space-flight is much more challenging. We find that chemical rockets still

We use a feed-forward artificial neural network with back-propagation through
a single hidden layer to predict Barry Cottonfield's likely reply to this
author's invitation to the "Once Upon a Daydream" junior prom at the Conard
High School gymnasium back in 1997. To examine the network's ability to
generalize to such a situation beyond specific training scenarios, we use a L2
regularization term in the cost function and examine performance over a range
of regularization strengths. In addition, we examine the nonsensical
decision-making strategies that emerge in Barry at times when he has recently
engaged in a fight with his annoying kid sister Janice. To simulate Barry's
inability to learn efficiently from large mistakes (an observation well
documented by his algebra teacher during sophomore year), we choose a simple
quadratic form for the cost function, so that the weight update magnitude is
not necessary correlated with the magnitude of output error.
  Network performance on test data indicates that this author would have
received an 87.2 (1)% chance of "Yes" given a particular set of environmental
input parameters. Most critically, the optimal method of question delivery is
found to be Secret Note rather than Verbal Speech. There also exists mild
evidence that wearing a burgundy mini-dress might have helped. The network
performs comparably for all values of regularization strength, which suggests
that the nature of noise in a high school hallway during passing time does not
affect much of anything. We comment on possible biases inherent in the output,
implications regarding the functionality of a real biological network, and
future directions. Over-training is also discussed, although the linear algebra
teacher assures us that in Barry's case this is not possible.

While the costs of human violence have attracted a great deal of attention
from the research community, the effects of the network-on-network (NoN)
violence popularised by Generative Adversarial Networks have yet to be
addressed. In this work, we quantify the financial, social, spiritual,
cultural, grammatical and dermatological impact of this aggression and address
the issue by proposing a more peaceful approach which we term Generative
Unadversarial Networks (GUNs). Under this framework, we simultaneously train
two models: a generator G that does its best to capture whichever data
distribution it feels it can manage, and a motivator M that helps G to achieve
its dream. Fighting is strictly verboten and both models evolve by learning to
respect their differences. The framework is both theoretically and electrically
grounded in game theory, and can be viewed as a winner-shares-all two-player
game in which both players work as a team to achieve the best score.
Experiments show that by working in harmony, the proposed model is able to
claim both the moral and log-likelihood high ground. Our work builds on a rich
history of carefully argued position-papers, published as anonymous YouTube
comments, which prove that the optimal solution to NoN violence is more GUNs.

<div class="abstract" style="display:none;"><br>
We present a functional model of neuronal network connectivity in which the
single architectural element is the object commonly known in handicraft circles
as a pipe cleaner. We argue that the dual nature of a neuronal circuit - that
it be at times highly robust to external manipulation and yet sufficiently
flexible to allow for learning and adaptation - is embodied in the pipe
cleaner, and thus that a pipe cleaner framework serves as an instructive
scaffold in which to examine network dynamics. Regarding the dynamics
themselves: as pipe cleaners possess no intrinsic dynamics, in our model we
attribute the emergent circuit dynamics to magic. Magic is a strategy that has
been largely neglected in the neuroscience community, and may serve as an
illuminating comparison to the common physics-based approaches. This model
makes predictions that it would be really awesome to test experimentally.
Moreover, the relative simplicity of the pipe cleaner - setting aside the fact
that it comes in an overwhelming variety of colors - renders it an excellent
theoretical building block with which to create simple network models. Also,
they are incredibly cheap when bought wholesale on Amazon.

Deviations of the observed cosmic microwave background (CMB) from the
standard model, known as "anomalies", are obviously highly significant and
deserve to be pursued more aggressively in order to discover the physical
phenomena underlying them. Through intensive investigation we have discovered
that there are equally surprising features in the digits of the number $\pi$,
and moreover there is a remarkable correspondence between each type of
peculiarity in the digits of $\pi$ and the anomalies in the CMB. Putting aside
the unreasonable possibility that these are just the sort of flukes that appear
when one looks hard enough, the only conceivable conclusion is that, however
the CMB anomalies were created, a similar process imprinted patterns in the
digits of $\pi$.

The last two decades have seen the number of known exoplanets increase from a
small handful to nearly 2000 known exoplanets, thousands more planet
candidates, and several upcoming missions that are expected to further increase
the population of known exoplanets. Beyond the strictly scientific questions
that this has led to regarding planet formation and frequency, this has also
led to broader questions such as the philosophical implications of life
elsewhere in the universe and the future of human civilization and space
exploration. One additional realm that hasn't been adequately considered,
however, is that this large increase in exoplanets would also impact claims
regarding astrology. In this paper we look at the distribution of planets
across the sky and along the Ecliptic, as well as the current and future
implications of this planet distribution.

Since its discovery in 1930, Pluto's mass has been a value that has
repeatedly been calculated. Additionally, the search for Planet X prior to
Pluto's discovery results in mass calculations that date back several decades
earlier. Over its observed history, the mass of Pluto has consistently
decreased. We reassess earlier predictions of Pluto's fate, and rule out the
hypothesis that Pluto's mass has been constant over the last century. We are
able to fit linear and quadratic equations to Pluto's mass as a function of
both time and distance. The observations that will be made by New Horizons will
help to determine if we can expect Pluto to continue to shrink until it has
negative mass, or if it will begin to increase in mass again.

Some of the most obviously correct physical theories - namely string theory
and the multiverse - make no testable predictions, leading many to question
whether we should accept something as scientific even if it makes no testable
predictions and hence is not refutable. However, some far-thinking physicists
have proposed instead that we should give up on the notion of Falsifiability
itself. We endorse this suggestion but think it does not go nearly far enough.
We believe that we should also dispense with other outdated ideas, such as
Fidelity, Frugality, Factuality and other "F" words. And we quote a lot of
famous people to support this view.

Those that do not sow care little about such mundane things as equinoxes or
planting seasons, or even crop rotation for that matter. Wherever and whenever
the reavers reave, the mood is always foul and the nights are never warm or
pleasant. For the rest of the good folks of Westeros, however, a decent grasp
of the long-term weather forecast is a necessity. Many a maester have tried to
play the Game of Weather Patterns and foretell when to plant those last turnip
seeds, hoping for a few more years of balmy respite. Tried and failed. For
other than the somewhat vague (if not outright meaningless) omens of "Winter is
Coming", their meteorological efforts have been worse than useless. To right
that appalling wrong, here we attempt to explain the apparently erratic
seasonal changes in the world of G.R.R.M. A natural explanation for such
phenomena is the unique behavior of a circumbinary planet. Thus, by speculating
that the planet under scrutiny is orbiting a pair of stars, we utilize the
power of numerical three-body dynamics to predict that, unfortunately, it is
not possible to predict either the length, or the severity of any coming
winter. We conclude that, alas, the Maesters were right -- one can only throw
their hands in the air in frustration and, defeated by non-analytic solutions,
mumble "Coming winter? May be long and nasty (~850 days, T<268K) or may be
short and sweet (~600 days, T~273K). Who knows..."

Based on the cosmological results of the Planck Mission, we show that all
parameters describing our Universe within the \Lambda CDM model can be
constructed from a small set of numbers known from conspiracy theory. Our
finding is confirmed by recent data from high energy particle physics. This
clearly demonstrates that our Universe is a plot initiated by an unknown
interest group or lodge. We analyse possible scenarios for this conspiracy, and
conclude that the belief in the existence of our Universe is an illusion, as
previously assumed by ancient philosophers, 20th century science fiction
authors and contemporary film makers.

Existing and future wide-field photometric surveys will produce a time-lapse
movie of the sky that will revolutionize our census of variable and moving
astronomical and atmospheric phenomena. As with any revolution in scientific
measurement capability, this new species of data will also present us with
results that are sure to surprise and confound our understanding of the cosmos.
While we cannot predict the unknown yields of such endeavors, it is a
beneficial exercise to explore certain parameter spaces using reasonable
assumptions for rates and observability. To this end I present a simple
parameterized model of the detectability of unidentified flying objects (UFOs)
with the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). I also demonstrate that the
LSST is well suited to place the first systematic constraints on the rate of
UFO and extraterrestrial visits to our world.

relationship between the two components, and no understanding of the nature of
the mysteries of the Dark Sector. Here we suggest that if the Dark Side is so
seductive then we should not be restricted to just 2 components. We further
suggest that the most natural model has 5 distinct forms of Dark Energy in
