Statistical evidence has previously suggested that the Galactic Center GeV
Excess (GCE) originates largely from point sources, and not from annihilating
dark matter. We examine the impact of unmodeled source populations on
identifying the true origin of the GCE using non-Poissonian template fitting
(NPTF) methods. In a proof-of-principle example with simulated data, we
discover that unmodeled sources in the Fermi Bubbles can lead to a dark matter
signal being misattributed to point sources by the NPTF. We discover striking
behavior consistent with a mismodeling effect in the real Fermi data, finding
that large artificial injected dark matter signals are completely misattributed
to point sources. Consequently, we conclude that dark matter may provide a
dominant contribution to the GCE after all.

Atmospheric neutrinos at low energies, $E \lsim 500$ MeV, is known to be a
rich source of information of lepton mixing parameters. We formulate a simple
perturbative framework to elucidate the characteristic features of neutrino
oscillation at around the solar-scale enhancement due to the matter effect. The
clearest message we could extract from our perturbation theory is that CP
violation in the appearance oscillation probability is large, a factor of $\sim
10$ times larger than CP violation at around the atmospheric-scale oscillation
maximum. Underlying mechanism for it is that one of the suppression factors on
the CP phase dependent terms due to smallness of $\Delta m^2_{21} / \Delta
m^2_{31}$ are dynamically lifted by the solar-scale enhancement. Our framework
has a unique feature as a perturbation theory in which large $\Delta m^2_{31}$
term outside the key 1-2 sector for the solar-scale resonance does not yield
sizeable corrections. On the contrary, the larger the $\Delta m^2_{31}$, the
smaller the higher order corrections.

We explore the capabilities of the upcoming Deep Underground Neutrino
Experiment (DUNE) to measure $\nu_\tau$ charged-current interactions and the
associated oscillation probability $P(\nu_\mu \to \nu_\tau)$ at its far
detector, concentrating on how such results can be used to probe neutrino
properties and interactions. DUNE has the potential to identify significantly
more $\nu_\tau$ events than all existing experiments and can use this data
sample to nontrivially test the three-massive-neutrinos paradigm by providing
complementary measurements to those from the $\nu_e$ appearance and $\nu_\mu$
disappearance channels. We further discuss the sensitivity of the $\nu_\tau$
appearance channel to several hypotheses for the physics that may lurk beyond
the three-massive-neutrinos paradigm: a non-unitary lepton mixing matrix, the
$3+1$ light neutrinos hypothesis, and the existence of non-standard
neutral-current neutrino interactions. Throughout, we also consider the
relative benefits of the proposed high-energy tune of the Long-Baseline
Neutrino Facility (LBNF) beam-line.

Neutrinos produced in extragalactic sources may experience
flavor-oscillations and decoherence on their way to Earth due to their
interaction with dark matter (DM). As a result, they may be detected in
pointer-states other than the flavor states at the source. The oscillation
pattern and the structure of the pointer-states can give us information on the
characteristics of the DM and the kind of interaction that has taken place.
From this perspective, neutrinos can be viewed as DM-tracers. We study the
local evolution of neutrino flavor-eigenstates due to local effects produced by
the presence of DM. To explore the sensitivity of the model, we consider
different DM density profiles, masses and interactions. Starting from the
eigenstates of the neutrino-mass Hamiltonian, we construct the flavor-states
with the neutrino mixing-matrix in vacuum. We then include local interactions
with DM, acting along the neutrino path towards the Earth, and analyse the
resulting probabilities. In doing so, we adopt different DM density profiles,
e.g. a constant, a local isotropic and a Navarro-Frenk-White density
distribution. Finally, by following the time evolution of the flavor-states, we
identify pointer-states and interpret the results in terms of the adopted DM
model. Due to the interaction with DM, neutrinos experience the MSW effect, the
extent of which depends on the DM density profile. The interaction with DM
produces the enhancement or suppression of oscillations. Decoherence effects
may take place. We model the time evolution of extragalactic neutrino
flavor-states by letting them interact with DM. The features of the calculated
response seem to support the notion that these neutrinos can be taken as DM
tracers. From a theoretical point of view, the coexistence and/or competition
of decoherence and MSW effects is sustained by the results.

Heavy neutrinos were sought in pion decays $\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ \nu$ by
examining the observed muon energy spectrum for extra peaks in addition to the
expected peak for a massless neutrino. No evidence for heavy neutrinos was
observed. Upper limits were set on the neutrino mixing matrix $|U_{\mu i}|^2$
in the neutrino mass region of 15.7--33.8 MeV/c$^2$, improving on previous
results by an order of magnitude.

We propose to use the unique event topology and reconstruction capabilities
of liquid argon time projection chambers to study sub-GeV atmospheric
neutrinos. The detection of low energy recoiled protons in DUNE allows for a
determination of the leptonic $CP$-violating phase independent from the
accelerator neutrino measurement. Our findings indicate that this analysis can
exclude several values of $\delta_{CP}$ beyond the $3\sigma$ level. Moreover,
the determination of the sub-GeV atmospheric neutrino flux will have important
consequences in the detection of diffuse supernova neutrinos and in dark matter
experiments.

A natural realization of CPT violation in neutrino oscillation can arise due
to the coupling to a light scalar or vector dark matter (DM). The dark
non-standard interaction (NSI) is associated with the $\gamma_0$ matrix in
neutrino's effective propagator and hence corrects the neutrino Hamiltonian as
dark matter potential, in the same way as the ordinary matter effect. The
effect is, however, inversely proportional to the neutrino energy and hence
appears as a correction to the neutrino mass squared. Due to a sign difference
in the corrections for neutrino and anti-neutrino modes, the neutrino
oscillation receives CPT violation from the dark NSI. Seeing difference in the
neutrino and anti-neutrino mass squared differences not necessarily leads to
the conclusion of CPT symmetry breaking in the fundamental Lagrangian but can
indicate light DM and its coupling with neutrinos.

Reconstructions of the primordial power spectrum (PPS) of curvature
perturbations from cosmic microwave background anisotropies and large-scale
structure data suggest that the usually assumed power-law PPS has localised
features (up to $\sim 10\%$ in amplitude), although of only marginal
significance in the framework of $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. On the other hand if
the underlying cosmology is assumed to be Einstein-de Sitter, larger features
in the PPS (up to $\sim 20\%$) are required to accurately fit the observed
acoustic peaks. Within the context of single clock inflation, we show that any
given reconstruction of the PPS can be mapped on to functional parameters of
the underlying effective theory of the adiabatic mode within a 2nd-order
formalism, provided the best fit fractional change of the PPS,
$\Delta\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}/\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}$ is such that
$(\Delta\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}/\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R})^3$ falls within the
$1\,\sigma$ confidence interval of the reconstruction for features induced by
variations of either the sound speed $c_\mathrm{s}$ or the slow-roll parameter
$\epsilon$. Although there is a degeneracy amongst these functional parameters
(and the models that project onto them), we can identify simple representative
inflationary models that yield such features in the PPS. Thus we provide a
dictionary (more accurately, a thesaurus) to go from observational data, via
the reconstructed PPS, to models that reproduce them to per cent level
precision.

<div class="abstract" style="display:none;"><br>
The cosmic-ray Sun shadow, which is caused by high-energy charged cosmic rays
being blocked and deflected by the Sun and its magnetic field, has been
observed by various experiments such as Argo-YBJ, HAWC, Tibet, and IceCube.
Most notably, the shadow's size and depth was recently shown to correlate with
the 11-year solar cycle. The interpretation of such measurements, which help to
bridge the gap between solar physics and high-energy particle astrophysics,
requires a solid theoretical understanding of cosmic-ray propagation in the
coronal magnetic field. It is the aim of this paper to establish theoretical
predictions for the cosmic-ray Sun shadow in order to identify observables that
can be used to study this link in more detail. To determine the cosmic-ray Sun
shadow, we numerically compute trajectories of charged cosmic rays in the
energy range of 5 to 316 TeV for five different mass numbers. We present and
analyse the resulting shadow images for protons and iron, as well as for
typically measured cosmic-ray compositions. We confirm the observationally
established correlation between the magnitude of the shadowing effect and both
the mean sunspot number and the polarity of the magnetic field during the solar
cycle. We also show that during low solar activity, the Sun's shadow behaves
similarly to that of a dipole, for which we find a non-monotonous dependence on
energy. In particular, the shadow can become significantly more pronounced than
the geometrical disk expected for a totally unmagnetized Sun. For times of high
solar activity, we instead predict the shadow to depend monotonously on energy,
and to be generally weaker than the geometrical shadow for all tested energies.
These effects should become visible in energy-resolved measurements of the Sun
shadow, and may in the future become an independent measure for the level of
disorder in the solar magnetic field.
