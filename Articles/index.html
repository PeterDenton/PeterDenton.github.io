Non-unitarity of the neutrino mixing matrix is expected in many scenarios
with physics beyond the Standard Model. Motivated by the search for deviations
from unitary, we study two neutrino counting observables: the
neutrino-antineutrino gamma process and the invisible $Z$ boson decay into
neutrinos. We report on new constraints for non-unitarity coming from the first
of this observables. We study the potential constraints that future collider
experiments will give from the invisible decay of the Z boson, that will be
measured with improved precision.

Current upper bounds on the sum of 3 active neutrino masses, $\sum m_{\nu}$
from analyses of cosmological data in the backdrop of $\Lambda\textrm{CDM}+\sum
m_{\nu}$ model are close to the minimum sum of neutrino masses required by the
inverted hierarchy, which is around 0.1 eV. However, these analyses are usually
done with the assumption of degenerate masses, which is not a good
approximation any more since the bounds are strong enough that the neutrino
mass-squared splittings can no longer be considered negligible. In this work we
update the bounds on $\sum m_{\nu}$ from latest publicly available cosmological
data while explicitly considering particular neutrino mass hierarchies. In the
minimal $\Lambda\textrm{CDM}+\sum m_{\nu}$ model with Planck 2015 TT,TE,EE,
BAO, Planck 2018 lensing, and a Gaussian prior on the reionization depth
$\tau=0.0506\pm0.0086$ from Planck 2018 lowE data, we find that at 95\% C.L.
the bounds are: $\sum m_{\nu}<0.122$ eV (degenerate), $\sum m_{\nu}<0.145$ eV
(normal), $\sum m_{\nu}<0.170$ eV (inverted); i.e., the bounds vary
significantly across the different mass orderings. Also, we find that the
normal hierarchy is mildly preferred to the inverted: $\Delta \chi^2 \equiv
\chi^2_{\textrm{NH}}- \chi^2_{\textrm{IH}} = -3.70$ (best-fit). In this paper
we also provide bounds on $\sum m_{\nu}$ considering different hierarchies in
various extended cosmological models: $\Lambda\textrm{CDM}+\sum m_{\nu}+r$,
$w\textrm{CDM}+\sum m_{\nu}$, $w_0 w_a \textrm{CDM}+\sum m_{\nu}$, $w_0 w_a
\textrm{CDM}+\sum m_{\nu}$ with $w(z)\geq -1$, $\Lambda \textrm{CDM} + \sum
m_{\nu} + \Omega_k$, and $\Lambda \textrm{CDM} + \sum m_{\nu} +
A_{\textrm{Lens}}$. We do not find any strong evidence of normal hierarchy over
inverted hierarchy from looking at the $\chi^2$ values in the extended models
either (abstract abridged).

Models of radiative Majorana neutrino masses require new scalars and/or
fermions to induce lepton number violating interactions. We show that these new
particles also generate observable neutrino nonstandard interactions (NSI) with
matter. We classify radiative models as type-I or II, with type-I models
containing at least one Standard Model (SM) particle inside the loop diagram
generating neutrino mass, and type-II models having no SM particle inside the
loop. While type-II radiative models do not generate NSI at tree-level, popular
models which fall under the type-I category are shown, somewhat surprisingly,
to generate observable NSI at tree-level, while being consistent with direct
and indirect constraints from colliders, electroweak precision data and charged
lepton flavor violation (cLFV). We survey such models where neutrino masses
arise at one, two and three loops. In the prototypical Zee model which
generates neutrino masses via one-loop diagrams involving charged scalars, we
find that diagonal NSI can be as large as ($8\%, 3.8\%, 43\%$) for
($\varepsilon_{ee},\varepsilon_{\mu \mu}, \varepsilon_{\tau \tau}$), while
off-diagonal NSI can be at most ($1.5 \times 10^{-3}\%, 0.56\%, 0.34\%$) for
($\varepsilon_{e\mu},\varepsilon_{e \tau}, \varepsilon_{\mu \tau}$). In
radiative neutrino mass models using leptoquarks (LQs),
$(\varepsilon_{\mu\mu},\, \varepsilon_{\tau\tau})$ can be as large as
$(21.6\%,\,51.7\%)$, while $\varepsilon_{ee}$ and $(\varepsilon_{e\mu},\,
\varepsilon_{e\tau},\,\varepsilon_{\mu\tau})$ can at most be 0.6\%. The most
stringent constraints on the diagonal NSI are found to come from neutrino
oscillation and scattering experiments, while the off-diagonal NSI are mostly
constrained by low-energy processes, such as atomic parity violation and cLFV.
We also comment on the future sensitivity of these models in long-baseline
experiments, such as DUNE.

Macroscopic dark matter refers to a variety of dark matter candidates that
would be expected to (elastically) scatter off of ordinary matter with a large
geometric cross-section. A wide range of macro masses $M_X$ and cross-sections
$\sigma_X$ remain unprobed. We show that over a wide region within the
unexplored parameter space, collisions of a macro with a human body would
result in serious injury or death. We use the absence of such unexplained
impacts with a well-monitored subset of the human population to exclude a
region bounded by $\sigma_X \geq 10^{-8} - 10^{-7}$ cm$^2$ and $M_X < 50$ kg.
Our results open a new window on dark matter: the human body as a dark matter
detector.

TUS (Tracking Ultraviolet Set-up) is the world's first orbital detector of
ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). It was launched into orbit on 28th
April 2016 as a part of the scientific payload of the Lomonosov satellite. The
main aim of the mission was to test the technique of measuring the ultraviolet
fluorescence and Cherenkov radiation of extensive air showers (EASs) generated
by primary cosmic rays with energies above ~100 EeV in the Earth atmosphere
from space. During its operation period, TUS registered almost 80,000 events
with a few of them satisfying conditions anticipated for EASs initiated by
UHECRs. Here we discuss an event registered on 3rd October 2016. The event was
measured in perfect observation conditions as an ultraviolet track in the
nocturnal atmosphere of the Earth, with the kinematics and the light curve
similar to those expected from an EAS. A reconstruction of the arrival
direction and energy of a primary particle gave the zenith angle around
$44^\circ$ and the energy of the primary particle ~1000 EeV. The extreme energy
clearly is not compatible with the cosmic ray energy spectrum obtained with
ground-based experiments. We discuss all conditions of registering the event,
explain the reconstruction procedure and its limitations in details and comment
on possible astrophysical and anthropogenic sources of the signal. We believe
the measurement is important for the future missions KLYPVE-EUSO and POEMMA,
aimed for studying UHECRs from space.

Neutrinos could decay. Invisible neutrino decay modes are difficult to target
at laboratory experiments, and current bounds on such decays from solar
neutrino and neutrino oscillation experiments are somewhat weak. It has been
known for some time that Cosmology can serve as a powerful probe of invisible
neutrino decays. In this work, we show that in order for Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis to be successful, the invisible neutrino decay lifetime should
be $\tau_\nu > 10^{-3}\,\text{s}$. We revisit Cosmic Microwave Background
constraints on invisible neutrino decays, and by using the latest Planck
observations we find that neutrino lifetimes $\tau_\nu < (1.2-0.3)\times
10^{9}\,\text{s} \, \left({m_\nu}/{ 0.05\,\text{eV} }\right)^3$ are excluded at
$95\%$ CL. We show that this bound is robust to modifications of the
cosmological model, in particular that it is independent of the presence of
dark radiation. We find that typical invisible neutrino decay modes with rates
$\tau_\nu < 10^{5}\,\text{s}\, \left({m_\nu}/{ 0.05\,\text{eV} }\right)^3$ are
disfavoured at more than $5\,\sigma$ with respect to $\Lambda$CDM given the
latest Planck CMB observations. Finally, we show that when including
high-$\ell$ Planck polarization data, neutrino lifetimes $\tau_\nu =
(2-14)\times 10^{9}\,\text{s} \, \left({m_\nu}/{ 0.05\,\text{eV} }\right)^3$
are mildly preferred -- with a 1-2 $\sigma$ significance -- over neutrinos
being stable.

The LSND and MiniBooNE results as well as the reactor and Gallium anomalies
seem to indicate the presence of a sterile neutrino with a mass of $\sim 1$ eV
mixed with active neutrinos. Such sterile neutrino can be produced in the early
universe before the neutrino decoupling, leading to a contribution to the
effective number of neutrinos ($N_{eff}$) as well as to a contribution to the
sum of neutrino masses which are in tension with cosmological observations. We
propose a scenario to relax this tension by a Yukawa coupling of the sterile
neutrinos to ultra-light scalar particles which contribute to the dark matter
in the background. The coupling induces an effective mass for $\nu_s$ which
prevents its production in the early universe. We discuss the implications for
the upcoming KATRIN experiment and future relic neutrino search experiments
such as PTOLEMY. We also briefly comment on certain non-renormalizable forms of
interaction between $\nu_s$ and the scalar and their consequences for the
$\nu_s$ production in the early universe.

We study direct detection bounds on cosmic ray-upscattered dark matter in
simplified models including light mediators. We find that the energy dependence
in the scattering cross section is significant, and produces stronger bounds
than previously found (which assumed constant cross sections) by many orders of
magnitude at low DM mass. Finally, we compute the "neutrino-floor" that will
limit future direct detection searches for cosmic ray-upscattered dark matter.
While we focus on vector interactions for illustration, we emphasize that the
energy dependence is critical in determining accurate bounds on any particle
physics model of Dark Matter-CR interactions from experimental data on this
scenario.

Theoretical predictions for elastic neutrino-electron scattering have no
hadronic or nuclear uncertainties at leading order making this process an
important tool for normalizing neutrino flux. However, the process is subject
to large radiative corrections that differ according to experimental
conditions. In this paper, we collect new and existing results for total and
differential cross sections accompanied by radiation of one photon, $\nu e \to
\nu e (\gamma)$. We perform calculations within the Fermi effective theory and
provide analytic expressions for the electron energy spectrum and for the total
electromagnetic energy spectrum as well as for double- and triple-differential
cross sections w.r.t. electron energy, electron angle, photon energy, and
photon angle. We discuss illustrative applications to accelerator-based
neutrino experiments and provide the most precise up-to-date values of
neutrino-electron scattering cross sections. We present an analysis of
theoretical error, which is dominated by the $\sim 0.2 - 0.4\%$ uncertainty on
the hadronic correction.

We propose an experimental setup to observe coherent elastic neutrino-atom
scattering (CE$\nu$AS) using electron antineutrinos from tritium decay and a
liquid helium target. In this scattering process with the whole atom, that has
not beeen observed so far, the electrons tend to screen the weak charge of the
nucleus as seen by the electron antineutrino probe. The interference between
the nucleus and the electron cloud produces a sharp dip in the recoil spectrum
at atomic recoil energies of about 9 meV, reducing sizeably the number of
expected events with respect to the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus
scattering case. We estimate that with a 60 g tritium source surrounded by 500
kg of liquid helium in a cylindrical tank, one could observe the existence of
CE$\nu$AS processes at 3$\sigma$ in 5 years of data taking. Keeping the same
amount of helium and the same data-taking period, we test the sensitivity to
the Weinberg angle and a possible neutrino magnetic moment for three different
scenarios: 60 g, 160 g, and 500 g of tritium. In the latter scenario, the
Standard Model (SM) value of the Weinberg angle can be measured with a
statistical uncertainty of
$\sin^2{\vartheta_W^{\mathrm{SM}}}^{+0.015}_{-0.016}$. This would represent the
lowest-energy measurement of $\sin^2{\vartheta_W}$, with the advantage of being
not affected by the uncertainties on the neutron form factor of the nucleus as
the current lowest-energy determination. Finally, we study the sensitivity of
this apparatus to a possible electron neutrino magnetic moment and we find that
using 60 g of tritium it is possible to set an upper limit of about
$7\times10^{-13}\,\mu_B$ at 90% C.L., that is more than one order of magnitude
smaller than the current experimental limit.

We search for transient variations of the fine structure constant using data
from a European network of fiber-linked optical atomic clocks. By searching for
coherent variations in the recorded clock frequency comparisons across the
network, we significantly improve the constraints on transient variations of
the fine structure constant. For example, we constrain the variation in alpha
to <5*10^-17 for transients of duration 10^3 s. This analysis also presents a
possibility to search for dark matter, the mysterious substance hypothesised to
explain galaxy dynamics and other astrophysical phenomena that is thought to
dominate the matter density of the universe. At the current sensitivity level,
we find no evidence for dark matter in the form of topological defects (or,
more generally, any macroscopic objects), and we thus place constraints on
certain potential couplings between the dark matter and standard model
particles, substantially improving upon the existing constraints, particularly
for large (>~10^4 km) objects.

We present a new method of exactly calculating neutrino oscillation
probabilities in matter. We show that, given the eigenvalues, all mixing angles
follow surprisingly simply and the CP violating phase can also be trivially
determined. Then, to avoid the cumbersome expressions for the exact
eigenvalues, we have applied previously derived perturbatively approximate
eigenvalues to this scheme and found it to be incredibly precise. We also find
that these eigenvalues converge at a rate of five orders of magnitude which is
the square of the naive expectation.

Beam neutrino oscillation experiments typically employ only one detector at a
certain baseline, apart from the near detector that measures the unoscillated
neutrino flux at the source. Lately, there have been discussions of having
detectors at two different baselines in one of the future long-baseline
neutrino oscillation experiments. We study the potential advantage of a general
dual-baseline system and perform analysis with a specific example of the
envisioned T2HKK experiment. We introduce a new parameter to exploit the
correlation between the oscillations at both baselines, and show how it can
help in determining the mass hierarchy and the CP phase in the neutrino sector.
Our study and findings can be generically used for any dual-baseline system.

Non-standard neutrino self interactions (NSSI) could be stronger than Fermi
interactions. We investigate the ability to constrain these four-neutrino
interactions by their effect on the flux of neutrinos originating from a
galactic supernova. In the dense medium of a core collapse supernova, these new
self interactions can have a significant impact on neutrino oscillations,
leading to changes at the flavor evolution and spectra level. We use
simulations of the neutrino flux from a 13 solar mass, core collapse supernova
at 10 kpc away, and numerically propagate these neutrinos through the stellar
medium taking into account vacuum/MSW oscillations, SM $\nu-\nu$ scattering as
well as $\nu-\nu$ interactions that arise from NSSI. We pass the resulting
neutrino flux to a simulation of the future Hyper-Kamiokande detector to see
what constraints on NSSI parameters are possible when the next galactic
supernova becomes visible. We find that these constraints depend strongly on
the neutrino mass hierarchy and if the NSSI is flavor-violating or preserving.
Sensitivity to NSSI in the normal hierarchy (NH) at Hyper-K is limited by the
experiment's ability to efficiently detect $\nu_{e}$, but deviations from no

This report summarizes the present status of neutrino non-standard
interactions (NSI). After a brief overview, several aspects of NSIs are
discussed, including connection to neutrino mass models, model-building and
phenomenology of large NSI with both light and heavy mediators, NSI
phenomenology in both short- and long-baseline neutrino oscillation
experiments, neutrino cross-sections, complementarity of NSI with other low-
and high-energy experiments, fits with neutrino oscillation and scattering
data, DUNE sensitivity to NSI, effective field theory of NSI, as well as the
relevance of NSI to dark matter and cosmology. We also discuss the open
questions and interesting future directions that can be pursued by the
community at large. This report is based on talks and discussions during the
Neutrino Theory Network NSI workshop held at Washington University in St. Louis
from May 29-31, 2019 (https://indico.cern.ch/event/812851/)

Quasi-Dirac neutrinos are obtained when the Lagrangian density of a neutrino
mass model contains both Dirac and Majorana mass terms, and the Majorana terms
are sufficiently small. This type of neutrinos introduces new mixing angles and
mass splittings into the Hamiltonian, which will modify the standard neutrino
oscillation probabilities. In this paper, we focus on the case where the new
mass splittings are too small to be measured, but new angles and phases are
present. We perform a sensitivity study for this scenario for the upcoming
experiments DUNE and JUNO, finding that they will improve current bounds on the
relevant parameters. Finally, we also explore the discovery potential of both
experiments, assuming that neutrinos are indeed quasi-Dirac particles.

time Borexino event rate measurements of $pp$, $pep$ and $^{7}Be$ solar
neutrinos. The limits improve several previous ones from TEXONO and CHARM-II

The gallium anomaly, i.e. the missing electron-neutrino flux from $^{37}$Ar
and $^{51}$Cr electron-capture decays as measured by the GALLEX and SAGE
solar-neutrino detectors, has been among us already for about two decades. We
present here a new estimate of the significance of this anomaly based on
cross-section calculations using nuclear shell-model wave functions obtained by
exploiting recently developed two-nucleon interactions. The gallium anomaly of
the GALLEX and SAGE experiments is found to be smaller than that obtained in
previous evaluations, decreasing the significance from 3.0$\sigma$ to
2.3$\sigma$. This result is compatible with the recent indication in favor of
short-baseline $\bar\nu_{e}$ disappearance due to small active-sterile neutrino
mixing obtained from the combined analysis of the data of the NEOS and DANSS

We propose a novel strategy to search for new physics in timing spectra,
envisioning the situation in which a new particle comes from the decay of its
heavier partner with a finite particle width. The timing distribution of events
induced by the dark matter particle scattering at the detector may populate in
a relatively narrow range, forming a "resonance-like" shape. Due to this
structural feature, the signal may be isolated from the backgrounds, in
particular when the backgrounds are uniformly distributed in energy and time.
For proof of the principle, we investigate the discovery potential for dark
matter from the decay of a dark photon in the COHERENT experiment, and show the
exciting prospects for exploring the associated parameter space with this
experiment. We analyze the existing CsI detector data with a timing cut and an
energy cut, and find, for the first time, an excess in the timing distribution
which can be explained by such dark matter. We compare the sensitivity to the
kinetic mixing parameter ($\epsilon$) for current and future COHERENT
experiments with the projected limits from LDMX and DUNE.

While the low-energy excess observed at MiniBooNE remains unchallenged, it
has become increasingly difficult to reconcile it with the results from other
sterile neutrino searches and cosmology. Recently, it has been shown that
non-minimal models with new particles in a hidden sector could provide a better
fit to the data. As their main ingredients they require a GeV-scale $Z'$,
kinetically mixed with the photon, and an unstable heavy neutrino with a mass
in the 150 MeV range that mixes with the light neutrinos. In this letter we
point out that atmospheric neutrino experiments (and, in particular,
IceCube/DeepCore) could probe a significant fraction of the parameter space of
such models by looking for an excess of "double-bang" events at low energies,
as proposed in our previous work (arXiv:1707.08573). Such a search would probe
exactly the same production and decay mechanisms required to explain the
anomaly.

We examine the compatibility between the Neutrino Option, in which the
electroweak scale is generated by PeV mass type I seesaw Majorana neutrinos,
and leptogenesis. We find the Neutrino Option is consistent with resonant
leptogenesis. Working within the minimal seesaw scenario with two heavy
Majorana neutrinos $N_{1,2}$, which form a pseudo-Dirac pair, we explore the
viable parameter space. We find that the Neutrino Option and successful
leptogenesis are compatible in the cases of a neutrino mass spectrum with
normal (inverted) ordering for $1.2 \times 10^6 < M \text{ (GeV)} < 8.8 \times
10^6$ ($2.4 \times 10^6 < M \text{ (GeV)} < 7.4 \times 10^6$), with $M = (M_1 +
M_2)/2$ and $M_{1,2}$ the masses of $N_{1,2}$. Successful leptogenesis requires
that $\Delta M/M \equiv (M_2 - M_1)/M \sim 10^{-8}$. We further show that
leptogenesis can produce the baryon asymmetry of the Universe within the
Neutrino Option scenario when the requisite CP violation in leptogenesis is
provided exclusively by the Dirac or Majorana low energy CP violation phases of
the PMNS matrix.

Imaging the immediate vicinity of supermassive black holes (SMBH) and
extracting a BH-spin signature is one of the grand challenges in astrophysics.
M87 is known as one of the best targets for imaging the BH shadow and it can be
partially thick against synchrotron self-absorption (SSA), particularly in a
flaring state with high mass accretion rate. However, little is known about
influences of the SSA-thick region on BH shadow images. Here we investigate BH
shadow images of M87 at 230 GHz properly taking into account the SSA-thick
region. When the BH has a high spin value, the corresponding BH shadow image
shows the positional offset between the center of the photon ring and that of
the SSA-thick ring at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) due to the
frame-dragging effect in the Kerr spacetime. As a result, we find that a
dark-crescent structure is generally produced between the photon ring and the
SSA-thick ISCO ring in the BH shadow image. The scale size of the dark-crescent
increase with BH spin: its width reaches up to $\sim 2$ gravitational radius
when the BH spin is 99.8% of its maximum value. The dark crescent is regarded
as a new signature of a highly spinning BH. This feature is expected to appear
in flaring states with relatively high mass accretion rate rather than the
quiescent states. We have simulated the image reconstruction of our theoretical
image by assuming the current and future Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) array,
and have found that the future EHT including space-very long baseline
interferometry in 2020s can detect the dark crescent.

Neutrino capture on beta-decaying nuclei is currently the only known
potentially viable method of detection of cosmic background neutrinos. It is
based on the idea of separation of the spectra of electrons or positrons
produced in captures of relic neutrinos on unstable nuclei from those from the
usual $\beta$-decay and requires very high energy resolution of the detector,
comparable to the neutrino mass. In this paper we suggest an alternative method
of discrimination between neutrino capture and $\beta$-decay, based on periodic
variations of angular correlations in inverse beta decay transitions induced by
relic neutrino capture. The time variations are expected to arise due to the
peculiar motion of the Sun with respect to the C$\nu$B rest frame and the
rotation of the Earth about its axis and can be observed in experiments with
both polarized and unpolarized nuclear targets. The main advantage of the
suggested method is that it does not depend crucially on the energy resolution
of detection of the produced $\beta$-particles and can be operative even if
this resolution exceeds the largest neutrino mass.

There is a well known 2$\sigma$ tension in the measurements of the solar
$\Delta m^2$ between KamLAND and SNO/Super-K. Precise determination of the
solar $\Delta m^2$ is especially important in connection with current and
future long baseline CP violation measurements. Reference~\cite{Seo:2018rrb}
points out that currently running short baseline reactor neutrino experiments,
Daya Bay and RENO, can also constrain solar $\Delta m^2$ value as demonstrated
by a GLoBES simulation with a limited systematic uncertainty consideration. In
this work, the publicly available data, from Daya Bay (1,958 days) and RENO
(2,200 days) are used to constrain the solar $\Delta m^2$. Verification of our
method through $\Delta m^2_{ee}$ and $\sin^2 \theta_{13}$ measurements is
discussed in Appendix A. Using this verified method, reasonable constraints on
the solar $\Delta m^2$ are obtained using the current publicly available Daya
Bay and RENO data, both individually and combined. We find that the combined
data of Daya Bay and RENO set an upper limit on the Solar $\Delta m^2$ of 17
$\times 10^{-5}$ eV$^2$ at the 95\% C.L., including both systematic and
statistical uncertainties. This constraint is slightly more than twice the
KamLAND value. As this combined result is still statistics limited, even though
driven by Daya Bay data, the constraint will improve with the additional
running of this experiment.

The Borexino detector measures solar neutrino fluxes via neutrino-electron
elastic scattering. Observed spectra are determined by the solar-$\nu_{e}$
survival probability $P_{ee}(E)$, and the chiral couplings of the neutrino and
electron. Some theories of physics beyond the Standard Model postulate the
existence of Non-Standard Interactions (NSI's) which modify the chiral
couplings and $P_{ee}(E)$. In this paper, we search for such NSI's, in
particularly neutral-current-like interactions that modify the $\nu_e - e$ and
$\nu_\tau - e$ couplings, using Borexino Phase II data. Standard Solar Model
predictions of the solar neutrino fluxes for both high- and low-metallicity
assumptions are considered. No indication of new physics is found at the level
of sensitivity of the detector and constraints on the parameters of the NSI's
are placed. In addition, with the same dataset the value of $\sin^2\theta_W$ is
obtained with a precision comparable to that achieved in reactor antineutrino
experiments.

We extend a simple and compact method for calculating the three flavor
neutrino oscillation probabilities in uniform matter density to schemes with
sterile neutrinos, with favorable features inherited. The only constraint of
the extended method is that the scale of the matter potential is not
significantly larger than the atmospheric $\Delta m^2$, which is satisfied by
all the running and proposed accelerator oscillation experiments. Degeneracy of
the zeroth order eigensystem around solar and atmospheric resonances are
resolved. Corrections to the zeroth order results are restricted to no larger
than the ratio of the solar to the atmospheric $\Delta m^2$. The zeroth order
expressions are exact in vacuum because all the higher order corrections vanish
when the matter potential is set zero. Also because all the corrections are
continuous functions of matter potential, the zeroth order precision is much
better than $\Delta m^2_\odot/\Delta m^2_\text{atm}$ for weak matter effect.
Numerical tests are presented to verify the theoretical predictions of the
exceptional features. Moreover, possible applications of the method in
experiments to check the existence of sterile neutrinos are discussed.

Neutrinos may acquire small Dirac or Majorana masses by new low-energy
physics in terms of the chiral gravitational anomaly, as proposed by Dvali and
Funcke (2016). This model predicts fast neutrino decays, $\nu_i\to\nu_j+\phi$
and $\nu_i\to\overline{\nu}_j+\phi$, where the gravi-majorons $\phi$ are
pseudoscalar Nambu-Goldstone bosons. The final-state neutrino and antineutrino
distributions differ depending on the Dirac or Majorana mass of the initial
state. This opens a channel for distinguishing these cases, for example in the
spectrum of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. In passing, we put strong
bounds on the decay of the heaviest neutrino to a light pseudoscalar,
${\tau_3}/{m_3}> 2.2\times 10^{-5}{{\rm s}}/{{\rm eV}}$ at 90% CL, using data
from experiments searching for antineutrino appearance from the Sun.

Quantum computing technologies promise to revolutionize calculations in many
areas of physics, chemistry, and data science. Their power is expected to be
especially pronounced for problems where direct analogs of a quantum system
under study can be encoded coherently within a quantum computer. A first step
toward harnessing this power is to express the building blocks of known
physical systems within the language of quantum gates and circuits. In this
paper, we present a quantum calculation of an archetypal quantum system:
neutrino oscillations. We define gate arrangements that implement the neutral
lepton mixing operation and neutrino time evolution in two-, three-, and
four-flavor systems. We then calculate oscillation probabilities by coherently
preparing quantum states within the processor, time evolving them unitarily,
and performing measurements in the flavor basis, with close analogy to the
physical processes realized in neutrino oscillation experiments, finding
excellent agreement with classical calculations. We provide recipes for
modeling oscillation in the standard three-flavor paradigm as well as
beyond-standard-model scenarios, including systems with sterile neutrinos,
non-standard interactions, Lorentz symmetry violation, and anomalous
decoherence.

Unitarity of the $3\times 3$ lepton flavor mixing matrix $V$ is unavoidably
violated in a seesaw mechanism if its new heavy degrees of freedom are slightly
mixed with the active neutrino flavors. We propose to use the atomic transition
process ${\left| \rm e \right> \to\left|\rm g \right> + \gamma + \nu^{}_{i} +
\overline{\nu}^{}_{j}}$ (for $i, j = 1, 2, 3$), where $\left|\rm e \right>$ and
$\left|\rm g \right>$ stand respectively for the excited and ground levels of
an atomic system, to probe or constrain the unitarity-violating effects of $V$.
We find that the photon spectrum of this transition will be distorted by the
effects of $V V^\dagger \neq {\bf 1}$ and $V^\dagger V \neq {\bf 1}$ as
compared with the $V V^\dagger = V^\dagger V = {\bf 1}$ case. We locate certain
frequencies in the photon spectrum to minimize the degeneracy of effects of the
unitarity violation and uncertainties of the flavor mixing parameters
themselves. The requirements of a nominal experimental setup to test the
unitarity of $V$ are briefly discussed.

The initial data from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) on M87$^*$, the
supermassive black hole at the center of the M87 galaxy, provide direct
observational information on its mass, spin, and accretion disk properties. A
combination of the EHT data and other constraints provide evidence that M87$^*$
has a mass $\sim 6.5 \times 10^9\,M_\odot$ and dimensionless spin parameter
$|a^*|\gtrsim 0.5$. These determinations disfavor ultra light bosons of mass
$\mu_b\sim 10^{-21}$ eV, within the range considered for fuzzy dark matter,
invoked to explain dark matter distribution on $\sim$ kpc scales. Future
observations of M87$^*$ could be expected to strengthen our conclusions.

Statistical evidence has previously suggested that the Galactic Center GeV
Excess (GCE) originates largely from point sources, and not from annihilating
dark matter. We examine the impact of unmodeled source populations on
identifying the true origin of the GCE using non-Poissonian template fitting
(NPTF) methods. In a proof-of-principle example with simulated data, we
discover that unmodeled sources in the Fermi Bubbles can lead to a dark matter
signal being misattributed to point sources by the NPTF. We discover striking
behavior consistent with a mismodeling effect in the real Fermi data, finding
that large artificial injected dark matter signals are completely misattributed
to point sources. Consequently, we conclude that dark matter may provide a
dominant contribution to the GCE after all.

Atmospheric neutrinos at low energies, $E \lsim 500$ MeV, is known to be a
rich source of information of lepton mixing parameters. We formulate a simple
perturbative framework to elucidate the characteristic features of neutrino
oscillation at around the solar-scale enhancement due to the matter effect. The
clearest message we could extract from our perturbation theory is that CP
violation in the appearance oscillation probability is large, a factor of $\sim
10$ times larger than CP violation at around the atmospheric-scale oscillation
maximum. Underlying mechanism for it is that one of the suppression factors on
the CP phase dependent terms due to smallness of $\Delta m^2_{21} / \Delta
m^2_{31}$ are dynamically lifted by the solar-scale enhancement. Our framework
has a unique feature as a perturbation theory in which large $\Delta m^2_{31}$
term outside the key 1-2 sector for the solar-scale resonance does not yield
sizeable corrections. On the contrary, the larger the $\Delta m^2_{31}$, the
smaller the higher order corrections.

We explore the capabilities of the upcoming Deep Underground Neutrino
Experiment (DUNE) to measure $\nu_\tau$ charged-current interactions and the
associated oscillation probability $P(\nu_\mu \to \nu_\tau)$ at its far
detector, concentrating on how such results can be used to probe neutrino
properties and interactions. DUNE has the potential to identify significantly
more $\nu_\tau$ events than all existing experiments and can use this data
sample to nontrivially test the three-massive-neutrinos paradigm by providing
complementary measurements to those from the $\nu_e$ appearance and $\nu_\mu$
disappearance channels. We further discuss the sensitivity of the $\nu_\tau$
appearance channel to several hypotheses for the physics that may lurk beyond
the three-massive-neutrinos paradigm: a non-unitary lepton mixing matrix, the
$3+1$ light neutrinos hypothesis, and the existence of non-standard
neutral-current neutrino interactions. Throughout, we also consider the
relative benefits of the proposed high-energy tune of the Long-Baseline
Neutrino Facility (LBNF) beam-line.

Neutrinos produced in extragalactic sources may experience
flavor-oscillations and decoherence on their way to Earth due to their
interaction with dark matter (DM). As a result, they may be detected in
pointer-states other than the flavor states at the source. The oscillation
pattern and the structure of the pointer-states can give us information on the
characteristics of the DM and the kind of interaction that has taken place.
From this perspective, neutrinos can be viewed as DM-tracers. We study the
local evolution of neutrino flavor-eigenstates due to local effects produced by
the presence of DM. To explore the sensitivity of the model, we consider
different DM density profiles, masses and interactions. Starting from the
eigenstates of the neutrino-mass Hamiltonian, we construct the flavor-states
with the neutrino mixing-matrix in vacuum. We then include local interactions
with DM, acting along the neutrino path towards the Earth, and analyse the
resulting probabilities. In doing so, we adopt different DM density profiles,
e.g. a constant, a local isotropic and a Navarro-Frenk-White density
distribution. Finally, by following the time evolution of the flavor-states, we
identify pointer-states and interpret the results in terms of the adopted DM
model. Due to the interaction with DM, neutrinos experience the MSW effect, the
extent of which depends on the DM density profile. The interaction with DM
produces the enhancement or suppression of oscillations. Decoherence effects
may take place. We model the time evolution of extragalactic neutrino
flavor-states by letting them interact with DM. The features of the calculated
response seem to support the notion that these neutrinos can be taken as DM
tracers. From a theoretical point of view, the coexistence and/or competition
of decoherence and MSW effects is sustained by the results.

Heavy neutrinos were sought in pion decays $\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ \nu$ by
examining the observed muon energy spectrum for extra peaks in addition to the
expected peak for a massless neutrino. No evidence for heavy neutrinos was
observed. Upper limits were set on the neutrino mixing matrix $|U_{\mu i}|^2$
in the neutrino mass region of 15.7--33.8 MeV/c$^2$, improving on previous
results by an order of magnitude.

We propose to use the unique event topology and reconstruction capabilities
of liquid argon time projection chambers to study sub-GeV atmospheric
neutrinos. The detection of low energy recoiled protons in DUNE allows for a
determination of the leptonic $CP$-violating phase independent from the
accelerator neutrino measurement. Our findings indicate that this analysis can
exclude several values of $\delta_{CP}$ beyond the $3\sigma$ level. Moreover,
the determination of the sub-GeV atmospheric neutrino flux will have important
consequences in the detection of diffuse supernova neutrinos and in dark matter
experiments.

A natural realization of CPT violation in neutrino oscillation can arise due
to the coupling to a light scalar or vector dark matter (DM). The dark
non-standard interaction (NSI) is associated with the $\gamma_0$ matrix in
neutrino's effective propagator and hence corrects the neutrino Hamiltonian as
dark matter potential, in the same way as the ordinary matter effect. The
effect is, however, inversely proportional to the neutrino energy and hence
appears as a correction to the neutrino mass squared. Due to a sign difference
in the corrections for neutrino and anti-neutrino modes, the neutrino
oscillation receives CPT violation from the dark NSI. Seeing difference in the
neutrino and anti-neutrino mass squared differences not necessarily leads to
the conclusion of CPT symmetry breaking in the fundamental Lagrangian but can
indicate light DM and its coupling with neutrinos.

Reconstructions of the primordial power spectrum (PPS) of curvature
perturbations from cosmic microwave background anisotropies and large-scale
structure data suggest that the usually assumed power-law PPS has localised
features (up to $\sim 10\%$ in amplitude), although of only marginal
significance in the framework of $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. On the other hand if
the underlying cosmology is assumed to be Einstein-de Sitter, larger features
in the PPS (up to $\sim 20\%$) are required to accurately fit the observed
acoustic peaks. Within the context of single clock inflation, we show that any
given reconstruction of the PPS can be mapped on to functional parameters of
the underlying effective theory of the adiabatic mode within a 2nd-order
formalism, provided the best fit fractional change of the PPS,
$\Delta\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}/\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}$ is such that
$(\Delta\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}/\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R})^3$ falls within the
$1\,\sigma$ confidence interval of the reconstruction for features induced by
variations of either the sound speed $c_\mathrm{s}$ or the slow-roll parameter
$\epsilon$. Although there is a degeneracy amongst these functional parameters
(and the models that project onto them), we can identify simple representative
inflationary models that yield such features in the PPS. Thus we provide a
dictionary (more accurately, a thesaurus) to go from observational data, via
the reconstructed PPS, to models that reproduce them to per cent level
precision.

The cosmic-ray Sun shadow, which is caused by high-energy charged cosmic rays
being blocked and deflected by the Sun and its magnetic field, has been
observed by various experiments such as Argo-YBJ, HAWC, Tibet, and IceCube.
Most notably, the shadow's size and depth was recently shown to correlate with
the 11-year solar cycle. The interpretation of such measurements, which help to
bridge the gap between solar physics and high-energy particle astrophysics,
requires a solid theoretical understanding of cosmic-ray propagation in the
coronal magnetic field. It is the aim of this paper to establish theoretical
predictions for the cosmic-ray Sun shadow in order to identify observables that
can be used to study this link in more detail. To determine the cosmic-ray Sun
shadow, we numerically compute trajectories of charged cosmic rays in the
energy range of 5 to 316 TeV for five different mass numbers. We present and
analyse the resulting shadow images for protons and iron, as well as for
typically measured cosmic-ray compositions. We confirm the observationally
established correlation between the magnitude of the shadowing effect and both
the mean sunspot number and the polarity of the magnetic field during the solar
cycle. We also show that during low solar activity, the Sun's shadow behaves
similarly to that of a dipole, for which we find a non-monotonous dependence on
energy. In particular, the shadow can become significantly more pronounced than
the geometrical disk expected for a totally unmagnetized Sun. For times of high
solar activity, we instead predict the shadow to depend monotonously on energy,
and to be generally weaker than the geometrical shadow for all tested energies.
These effects should become visible in energy-resolved measurements of the Sun
shadow, and may in the future become an independent measure for the level of
disorder in the solar magnetic field.
