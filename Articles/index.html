  Interactions</b><br>

A natural realization of CPT violation in neutrino oscillation can arise due
to the coupling to a light scalar or vector dark matter (DM). The dark
non-standard interaction (NSI) is associated with the $\gamma_0$ matrix in
neutrino's effective propagator and hence corrects the neutrino Hamiltonian as
dark matter potential, in the same way as the ordinary matter effect. The
effect is, however, inversely proportional to the neutrino energy and hence
appears as a correction to the neutrino mass squared. Due to a sign difference
in the corrections for neutrino and anti-neutrino modes, the neutrino
oscillation receives CPT violation from the dark NSI. Seeing difference in the
neutrino and anti-neutrino mass squared differences not necessarily leads to
the conclusion of CPT symmetry breaking in the fundamental Lagrangian but can
indicate light DM and its coupling with neutrinos.

Reconstructions of the primordial power spectrum (PPS) of curvature
perturbations from cosmic microwave background anisotropies and large-scale
structure data suggest that the usually assumed power-law PPS has localised
features (up to $\sim 10\%$ in amplitude), although of only marginal
significance in the framework of $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. On the other hand if
the underlying cosmology is assumed to be Einstein-de Sitter, larger features
in the PPS (up to $\sim 20\%$) are required to accurately fit the observed
acoustic peaks. Within the context of single clock inflation, we show that any
given reconstruction of the PPS can be mapped on to functional parameters of
the underlying effective theory of the adiabatic mode within a 2nd-order
formalism, provided the best fit fractional change of the PPS,
$\Delta\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}/\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}$ is such that
$(\Delta\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}/\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R})^3$ falls within the
$1\,\sigma$ confidence interval of the reconstruction for features induced by
variations of either the sound speed $c_\mathrm{s}$ or the slow-roll parameter
$\epsilon$. Although there is a degeneracy amongst these functional parameters
(and the models that project onto them), we can identify simple representative
inflationary models that yield such features in the PPS. Thus we provide a
dictionary (more accurately, a thesaurus) to go from observational data, via
the reconstructed PPS, to models that reproduce them to per cent level
precision.

The cosmic-ray Sun shadow, which is caused by high-energy charged cosmic rays
being blocked and deflected by the Sun and its magnetic field, has been
observed by various experiments such as Argo-YBJ, HAWC, Tibet, and IceCube.
Most notably, the shadow's size and depth was recently shown to correlate with
the 11-year solar cycle. The interpretation of such measurements, which help to
bridge the gap between solar physics and high-energy particle astrophysics,
requires a solid theoretical understanding of cosmic-ray propagation in the
coronal magnetic field. It is the aim of this paper to establish theoretical
predictions for the cosmic-ray Sun shadow in order to identify observables that
can be used to study this link in more detail. To determine the cosmic-ray Sun
shadow, we numerically compute trajectories of charged cosmic rays in the
energy range of 5 to 316 TeV for five different mass numbers. We present and
analyse the resulting shadow images for protons and iron, as well as for
typically measured cosmic-ray compositions. We confirm the observationally
established correlation between the magnitude of the shadowing effect and both
the mean sunspot number and the polarity of the magnetic field during the solar
cycle. We also show that during low solar activity, the Sun's shadow behaves
similarly to that of a dipole, for which we find a non-monotonous dependence on
energy. In particular, the shadow can become significantly more pronounced than
the geometrical disk expected for a totally unmagnetized Sun. For times of high
solar activity, we instead predict the shadow to depend monotonously on energy,
and to be generally weaker than the geometrical shadow for all tested energies.
These effects should become visible in energy-resolved measurements of the Sun
shadow, and may in the future become an independent measure for the level of
disorder in the solar magnetic field.
