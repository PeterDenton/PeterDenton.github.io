Tau neutrinos are unique cosmic messengers, especially at extreme energies.
When they undergo a charged-current interaction, the short lifetime of the
produced tau gives rise to secondary tau neutrinos that carry a significant
fraction of the primary neutrino energy. This effect, known as tau neutrino
regeneration, has not been applied to its full potential in current generation
neutrino experiments. In this work, we present an updated calculation of tau
neutrino regeneration, and explore its implications for two scenarios: the
recent anomalous ANITA events and the cosmogenic neutrino flux. For the former,
we investigate the idea of localized emission and find that the maximum
secondary neutrino flux allowed by IceCube measurements implies a primary flux
that is incompatible with the ANITA observation, regardless of the assumed
source energy spectrum. For the latter, we study the prospect of detecting the
cosmogenic neutrino flux of regenerated PeV neutrinos with current and next
generation neutrino detectors.

We study neutrino oscillations in a medium of dark matter which generalizes
the standard matter effect. A general formula is derived to describe the effect
of various mediums and their mediators to neutrinos. Neutrinos and
anti-neutrinos receive opposite contributions from asymmetric distribution of
(dark) matter and anti-matter, and thus it could appear in precision
measurement of neutrino or anti-neutrino oscillations. Furthermore, the
standard neutrino oscillation can occur from the symmetric dark matter effect
even for massless neutrinos.

Hints for the existence of a sterile neutrino at nuclear reactors are
reexamined using two updated predictions for the fluxes of antineutrinos
produced in fissions. These new predictions diverge in their preference for the
rate deficit anomaly, relative to previous analyses, but the anomaly in the
ratios of measured antineutrino spectra persists. We comment on upcoming
experiments and their ability to probe the preferred region of the

The distribution of arrival directions of cosmic rays is remarkably
isotropic, which is a consequence of their repeated scattering in magnetic
fields. Yet, high-statistics observatories like IceCube and HAWC have revealed
the presence of small-scale structures at levels of 1 part in 10,000 at
hundreds of TeV, which are not expected in typical diffusion models of cosmic
rays. We follow up on the suggestion that these small-scale anisotropies are a
result of cosmic ray streaming in a particular realisation of the turbulent
magnetic field within a few scattering lengths in our local Galactic
neighbourhood. So far, this hypothesis has been investigated mostly
numerically, by tracking test particles through turbulent magnetic fields. For
the first time, we present an analytical computation that through a
perturbative approach allows predicting the angular power spectrum of cosmic
ray arrival directions for a given model of turbulence. We illustrate this
method for a simple, isotropic turbulence model and we find remarkable
agreement with the results of numerical studies.

The ANITA experiment has registered two anomalous events that can be
interpreted as $\nu_\tau$ or $\bar{\nu}_\tau$ with a very high energy of
$\mathcal{O}(0.6)$~EeV emerging from deep inside the Earth. At such high
energies, the Earth is opaque to neutrinos so the emergence of these neutrinos
at such large zenith angles is a mystery. In our paper, we present a model that
explains the two anomalous events through a $L_e -L_\tau$ gauge interaction
involving two new Weyl fermions charged under the new gauge symmetry. We find
that, as a bonus of the model, the lighter Weyl fermion can be a dark matter
component. We discuss how the ANITA observation can be reconciled with the
IceCube and Auger upper bounds. We also demonstrate how this model can be
tested in future by collider experiments.

New physics can emerge at low energy scales, involving very light and very
weakly interacting new particles. These particles can mediate interactions
between neutrinos and usual matter and contribute to the Wolfenstein potential
in neutrino oscillations. We compute the Wolfenstein potential in the presence
of ultra-light scalar and vector mediators and study the dependence of the
potential on the mediator mass $m_A$, taking the finite size of matter
distribution (Earth, Sun, supernovae) into consideration. For ultra-light
mediators with $m_{A}^{-1}$ comparable to the size of the medium ($R$), the
conventional $m_{A}^{-2}$ dependence of the potential is modified. In
particular, when $m_{A}^{-1}\gg R$, the potential does not depend on $m_{A}$.
Taking into account existing bounds on light mediators, we find that for the
scalar case significant effects on neutrino propagation are not possible, while
for the vector case large matter effects are allowed for $m_{A} \in
[2\times10^{-17}$, $4\times10^{-14}]$ eV and the gauge coupling $g\sim
10^{-25}$.

We report on the neutrino mass measurement result from the first four-week
science run of the Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino experiment KATRIN in spring 2019.
Beta-decay electrons from a high-purity gaseous molecular tritium source are
energy analyzed by a high-resolution MAC-E filter. A fit of the integrated
electron spectrum over a narrow interval around the kinematic endpoint at 18.57
keV gives an effective neutrino mass square value of $(-1.0^{+0.9}_{-1.1})$
eV$^2$. From this we derive an upper limit of 1.1 eV (90$\%$ confidence level)
on the absolute mass scale of neutrinos. This value coincides with the KATRIN
sensitivity. It improves upon previous mass limits from kinematic measurements
by almost a factor of two and provides model-independent input to cosmological
studies of structure formation.

Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) is the dominant neutrino
scattering channel for neutrinos of energy $E_\nu < 100$ MeV. We report a limit
for this process using data collected in an engineering run of the 29 kg
CENNS-10 liquid argon detector located 27.5 m from the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) Hg target with $4.2\times 10^{22}$
protons on target. The dataset yielded $< 7.4$ observed CEvNS events implying a
cross section for the process, averaged over the SNS pion decay-at-rest flux,
of $<3.4 \times 10^{-39}$ cm$^{2}$, a limit within twice the Standard Model
prediction. This is the first limit on CEvNS from an argon nucleus and confirms
the earlier CsI non-standard neutrino interaction constraints from the
collaboration. This run demonstrated the feasibility of the ongoing
experimental effort to detect CEvNS with liquid argon.

In this paper, we study the effect of active-neutrino-sterile-neutrino mixing
in the expected high-energy astrophysical neutrino flavor content.
Non-unitarity in the measurement of the three active neutrinos can be due to
the existence of sterile neutrino states. We introduce the concept of the
four-flavor tetrahedron in order to visualize the lack of unitarity in the
astrophysical neutrino three-flavor triangle. We demonstrate that
active-sterile neutrino mixings modify the allowed region of the astrophysical
flavor ratio from the standard case. However, a projection of the four-flavor
tetrahedron has restrictions of phase space similar to the three-flavor
triangle. On the other hand, the initial presence of astrophysical sterile
neutrinos drastically changes the scenario, and it allows an apparent unitarity
violation in the three-flavor triangle space. Using current global fit
constraints including the non-unitarity case, we also illustrate the allowed
astrophysical neutrino flavor ratios. Thus, the measurement of the high-energy
astrophyscal neutrino flavor content allows us to explore sterile neutrinos
independently of the sterile neutrino mass scale. These are topics of
investigation for current and future neutrino telescopes.

The standard neutrino oscillation paradigm predicts almost equal fractions of
astrophysical neutrino flavors at Earth regardless of their production ratio at
the sources. Therefore, identification of astrophysical tau neutrinos could not
only reconfirm the astrophysical neutrino flux measured by IceCube, but also is
essential in precisely determining the astrophysical neutrino flavor ratio at
Earth, which is an important probe for physics beyond the Standard Model over
astronomical baselines. A tau neutrino undergoing a charged current (CC)
interaction in IceCube could produce a double deposition of energy, with the
first one from the CC hadronic shower and the second from the subsequent tau
lepton decay shower. Above an energy of ~100 TeV, such consecutive energy
depositions might be resolvable in the sensor waveforms and hence can be a
signature of an individual tau neutrino interaction in IceCube. We will present
the results of a search for astrophysical tau neutrinos in IceCube waveforms
with improved double pulse waveform identification techniques and using 8 years
of data.

Tau neutrino identification with the IceCube experiment would open new

neutrino sources. This work aims at a identification of tau neutrinos with
astrophysical origin at energies above 100TeV. For identification, we search
for a double pulse structure in the signal of one of IceCubes Digital Optical
Modules originating from a tau neutrino interaction and a subsequent tau decay

flux based on an event sample with a livetime of about 7.5 years of IceCube

We have conducted nineteen state-of-the-art 3D core-collapse supernova
simulations spanning a broad range of progenitor masses. This is the largest
collection of sophisticated 3D supernova simulations ever performed. We have
found that while the majority of these models explode, not all do, and that
even models in the middle of the available progenitor mass range may be less
explodable. This does not mean that those models for which we did not witness
explosion would not explode in Nature, but that they are less prone to
explosion than others. One consequence is that the "compactness" measure is not
a metric for explodability. We find that lower-mass massive star progenitors
likely experience lower-energy explosions, while the higher-mass massive stars
likely experience higher-energy explosions. Moreover, most 3D explosions have a
dominant dipole morphology, have a pinched, wasp-waist structure, and
experience simultaneous accretion and explosion. We reproduce the general range
of residual neutron-star masses inferred for the galactic neutron-star
population. The most massive progenitor models, however, in particular vis \`a
vis explosion energy, need to be continued for longer physical times to
asymptote to their final states. We find that while the majority of the inner
ejecta have Y$_e = 0.5$, there is a substantial proton-rich tail. This result
has important implications for the nucleosynthetic yields as a function of
progenitor. Finally, we find that the non-exploding models eventually evolve
into compact inner configurations that experience a quasi-periodic spiral SASI
mode. We otherwise see little evidence of the SASI in the exploding models.

A core-collapse supernova releases the vast majority of the gravitational
binding energy of its compact remnant in the form of neutrinos over an interval
of a few tens of seconds. In the event of a core-collapse supernova within our
galaxy, multiple current and future neutrino detectors would see a large burst
in activity. Neutrinos escape a supernova hours before light does, so any
prompt information about the supernova's direction that can be inferred via the
neutrino signal will help to enable early electromagnetic observations of the
supernova. While there are methods to determine the direction via intrinsic
directionality of some neutrino-matter interaction channels, a complementary
method which will reach maturity with the next generation of large neutrino
detectors is the use of relative neutrino arrival times at different detectors
around the globe. To evaluate this triangulation method for realistic detector
configurations of the next few decades, we generate random supernova neutrino
signals with realistic detector assumptions, and quantify the error in expected
time delay between detections. We investigate a practical and robust method of
estimating the time differences between burst detections, also correcting for
detection efficiency bias. With this method, we determine the pointing
precision of supernova neutrino triangulation as a function of supernova
distance and location, detectors used, detector background level and neutrino
mass ordering assumption. Under favorable conditions, the 1$\sigma$ supernova
search area from triangulation could be reduced to a few percent of the sky. It
should be possible to implement this method with low latency under realistic
conditions.

We report on searches for neutrinos and antineutrinos from astrophysical
sources performed with the Borexino detector at the Laboratori Nazionali del
Gran Sasso in Italy. Electron antineutrinos ($\bar{\nu}_e$) are detected in an
organic liquid scintillator through the inverse $\beta$-decay reaction. In the
present work we set model-independent upper limits in the energy range 1.8-16.8
MeV on neutrino fluxes from unknown sources that improve our previous results,
on average, by a factor 2.5. Using the same data set, we first obtain
experimental constraints on the diffuse supernova $\bar{\nu}_e$ fluxes in the
previously unexplored region below 8 MeV. A search for $\bar{\nu}_e$ in the
solar neutrino flux is also presented: the presence of $\bar{\nu}_e$ would be a
manifestation of a non-zero anomalous magnetic moment of the neutrino, making
possible its conversion to antineutrinos in the strong magnetic field of the
Sun. We obtain a limit for a solar $\bar{\nu}_e$ flux of 384 cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$
(90% C.L.), assuming an undistorted solar $^{8}$B neutrinos energy spectrum,
that corresponds to a transition probability $p_{ \nu_e \rightarrow
\bar\nu_{e}}<$ 7.2$\times$10$^{-5}$ (90% C.L.) for E$_{\bar {\nu}_e}$ $>$ 1.8
MeV. At lower energies, by investigating the spectral shape of elastic
scattering events, we obtain a new limit on solar $^{7}$Be-$\nu_e$ conversion
into $\bar{\nu}_e$ of $p_{ \nu_e \rightarrow \bar \nu_{e}}<$ 0.14 (90% C.L.) at
0.862 keV. Last, we investigate solar flares as possible neutrino sources and
obtain the strongest up-to-date limits on the fluence of neutrinos of all
flavor neutrino below 3-7 ,MeV. Assuming the neutrino flux to be proportional
to the flare's intensity, we exclude an intense solar flare as the cause of the
observed excess of events in run 117 of the Cl-Ar Homestake experiment.

A high concentration of ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) events, called a
hotspot, was reported by the Telescope Array (TA) experiment, but its origin
still remains unsolved. One of the obstacles is that there is no astronomical
object, which could be the source, behind the TA hotpot. In an effort to
understand the origin of the TA hotspot, we suggested a model based on the
magnetized cosmic web structure. The UHECRs were produced from sources in the
Virgo cluster and were initially confined by cluster magnetic fields for a
certain period. Next, some of them preferentially escaped to and propagated
along filaments. Eventually, they were scattered by filament magnetic fields,
and come to us. To examine the model, we followed the propagation trajectories
of UHE protons in a simulated universe with clusters, filaments, and voids, by
employing a number of models for cosmic magnetic fields. In this study, we
present some of the initial results, such as the ratio between the particles
directly escaping from the clusters to the voids and particles escaping from
the clusters to the filaments. We also discuss the feasibility of our model for
the origin of the hotspot by examining the trajectories of the UHE protons.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory detects atmospheric muon neutrinos above 100
GeV at a rate of about 100 000 per year. These neutrinos originate from decays
of charged pions and kaons in cosmic ray air showers. Their flux depends on the
probability of production and decay of the parent mesons, and is thus sensitive
to the stratospheric temperature. Neutrino rates from 8 years of operation of
the detector are correlated with the atmospheric temperature profile as
measured by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). An analysis of this
correlation provides a test of models of hadronic interactions in atmospheric
air showers. This analysis of neutrinos complements the analysis of the
correlation of atmospheric muons with temperature that is presented in another
paper at this conference.

Understanding neutrino oscillations in matter requires a non-trivial
diagonalization of the Hamiltonian. As the exact solution is very complicated,
many approximation schemes have been pursued. Here we show that one scheme,
systematically applying rotations to change to a better basis, converges
exponentially fast wherein the rate of convergence follows the Fibonacci
sequence. The results presented here are generally applicable to systems beyond
neutrino oscillations as well.

The mixing of active neutrinos with their sterile counterparts with keV mass
is known to have a potentially major impact on the energy loss from the
supernova core. By relying on a set of three static hydrodynamical backgrounds
mimicking the early accretion phase and the Kelvin-Helmoltz cooling phase of a
supernova, we develop the first self-consistent, radial- and time-dependent
treatment of mixing between sterile and tau neutrinos in the dense stellar
core. We follow the flavor evolution by including ordinary matter effects,
collisional production of sterile neutrinos, as well as reconversions of
sterile states into active ones. The dynamical feedback of the sterile neutrino
production on the matter background leads to the development of a tau neutrino
lepton asymmetry that grows in time until it reaches a stationary value larger
than 0.2. Our results hint towards significant implications for the supernova
physics, and call for a self-consistent modeling of the sterile neutrino
transport in the supernova core to constrain the mixing parameters of sterile
neutrinos.

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory measured a flux of high-energy astrophysical
neutrinos in several detection channels. The energy spectrum is fitted as
unbroken power-law, but different best-fit parameters were obtained in the
various analyses covering different energy ranges between few TeV to 10 PeV.
Here, we present an update to the analysis of through-going muon-neutrinos from
the Northern Hemisphere. It was extended to almost ten years of data and an
improved treatment of systematic uncertainties on the atmospheric fluxes was
implemented. The updated best-fit parameters for the astrophysical flux
assuming a power-law energy spectrum are $\Phi_{astro}=1.44$ and
$\gamma_{astro}=2.28$. We will present the results of the spectral fit and
discuss how the measured flux compares to other IceCube results.

We investigate the expected high-energy neutrino fluence from internal shocks
produced in the relativistic outflow of gamma-ray bursts. Previous model
predictions have primarily focussed on on-axis observations of uniform jets.
Here we present a generalization to account for arbitrary viewing angles and
jet structures. Based on this formalism, we provide an improved scaling
relation that expresses off-axis neutrino fluences in terms of on-axis model
predictions. We also find that the neutrino fluence from structured jets can
exhibit a strong angular dependence relative to that of gamma-rays and can be
far more extended. We examine this behavior in detail for the recent short

The IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole, which detects Cherenkov
light from charged particles produced in neutrino interactions, firmly
established the existence of an astrophysical high-energy neutrino component.
The expected neutrino flavor composition on Earth is
$\nu_e:\nu_{\mu}:\nu_{\tau}$ of about 1:1:1 for neutrinos produced in
astrophysical sources through pion decay. A measurement of the flavor
composition on Earth can provide important constraints on sources and
production mechanisms within the standard model, and can also constrain various
beyond-standard-model processes. Here the measurement of the flavor composition
performed on IceCube's High-Energy Starting Events sample with a livetime of
about 7.5 years is presented. IceCube is directly sensitive to each neutrino
flavor via the single cascade, track and double cascade event topologies. In
IceCube, $\nu_{\tau}$-CC interactions above $\sim$ 100 TeV can produce
resolvable double cascades, breaking the degeneracy between $\nu_e$ and
$\nu_{\tau}$ present at lower energies. IceCube's first two identified double
cascades are presented and the properties of the two $\nu_{\tau}$ candidates
are discussed.

All information produced by these searches such as time, type, direction,

Neutrinos are copiously produced at particle colliders, but no collider
neutrino has ever been detected. Colliders, and particularly hadron colliders,
produce both neutrinos and anti-neutrinos of all flavors at very high energies,
and they are therefore highly complementary to those from other sources. FASER,
the recently approved Forward Search Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider,
is ideally located to provide the first detection and study of collider
neutrinos. We investigate the prospects for neutrino studies of a proposed
component of FASER, FASER$\nu$, a 25cm x 25cm x 1.35m emulsion detector to be
placed directly in front of the FASER spectrometer in tunnel TI12. FASER$\nu$
consists of 1000 layers of emulsion films interleaved with 1-mm-thick tungsten
plates, with a total tungsten target mass of 1.2 tons. We estimate the neutrino
fluxes and interaction rates at FASER$\nu$, describe the FASER$\nu$ detector,
and analyze the characteristics of the signals and primary backgrounds. For an
integrated luminosity of 150 fb$^{-1}$ to be collected during Run 3 of the 14
TeV Large Hadron Collider from 2021-23, and assuming standard model cross
sections, approximately 1300 electron neutrinos, 20,000 muon neutrinos, and 20
tau neutrinos will interact in FASER$\nu$, with mean energies of 600 GeV to 1
TeV, depending on the flavor. With such rates and energies, FASER will measure
neutrino cross sections at energies where they are currently unconstrained,
will bound models of forward particle production, and could open a new window
on physics beyond the standard model.

Current upper bounds on the sum of 3 active neutrino masses, $\sum m_{\nu}$
from analyses of cosmological data in the backdrop of $\Lambda\textrm{CDM}+\sum
m_{\nu}$ model are close to the minimum sum of neutrino masses required by the
inverted hierarchy, which is around 0.1 eV. However, these analyses are usually
done with the assumption of degenerate masses, which is not a good
approximation any more since the bounds are strong enough that the neutrino
mass-squared splittings can no longer be considered negligible. In this work we
update the bounds on $\sum m_{\nu}$ from latest publicly available cosmological
data and likelihoods while explicitly considering particular neutrino mass
hierarchies. In the minimal $\Lambda\textrm{CDM}+\sum m_{\nu}$ model with most
recent CMB data from Planck 2018 TT,TE,EE, lowE, and lensing; and BAO data from
BOSS DR12, MGS, and 6dFGS, we find that at 95% C.L. the bounds are: $\sum
m_{\nu}<0.121$ eV (degenerate), $\sum m_{\nu}<0.146$ eV (normal), $\sum
m_{\nu}<0.172$ eV (inverted); i.e., the bounds vary significantly across the
different mass orderings. Also, we find that the normal hierarchy is very
mildly preferred relative to the inverted: $\Delta \chi^2 \equiv
\chi^2_{\textrm{NH}}- \chi^2_{\textrm{IH}} = -0.95$ (best-fit). In this paper
we also provide bounds on $\sum m_{\nu}$ considering different hierarchies in
various extended cosmological models: $\Lambda\textrm{CDM}+\sum m_{\nu}+r$,
$w\textrm{CDM}+\sum m_{\nu}$, $w_0 w_a \textrm{CDM}+\sum m_{\nu}$, $w_0 w_a
\textrm{CDM}+\sum m_{\nu}$ with $w(z)\geq -1$, $\Lambda \textrm{CDM} + \sum
m_{\nu} + \Omega_k$, and $\Lambda \textrm{CDM} + \sum m_{\nu} +
A_{\textrm{Lens}}$. We do not find any strong evidence of normal hierarchy over
inverted hierarchy from looking at the $\chi^2$ values in the extended models
either.(abstract abridged).

Models of radiative Majorana neutrino masses require new scalars and/or
fermions to induce lepton number violating interactions. We show that these new
particles also generate observable neutrino nonstandard interactions (NSI) with
matter. We classify radiative models as type-I or II, with type-I models
containing at least one Standard Model (SM) particle inside the loop diagram
generating neutrino mass, and type-II models having no SM particle inside the
loop. While type-II radiative models do not generate NSI at tree-level, popular
models which fall under the type-I category are shown, somewhat surprisingly,
to generate observable NSI at tree-level, while being consistent with direct
and indirect constraints from colliders, electroweak precision data and charged
lepton flavor violation (cLFV). We survey such models where neutrino masses
arise at one, two and three loops. In the prototypical Zee model which
generates neutrino masses via one-loop diagrams involving charged scalars, we
find that diagonal NSI can be as large as ($8\%, 3.8\%, 43\%$) for
($\varepsilon_{ee},\varepsilon_{\mu \mu}, \varepsilon_{\tau \tau}$), while
off-diagonal NSI can be at most ($1.5 \times 10^{-3}\%, 0.56\%, 0.34\%$) for
($\varepsilon_{e\mu},\varepsilon_{e \tau}, \varepsilon_{\mu \tau}$). In
radiative neutrino mass models using leptoquarks (LQs),
$(\varepsilon_{\mu\mu},\, \varepsilon_{\tau\tau})$ can be as large as
$(21.6\%,\,51.7\%)$, while $\varepsilon_{ee}$ and $(\varepsilon_{e\mu},\,
\varepsilon_{e\tau},\,\varepsilon_{\mu\tau})$ can at most be 0.6\%. The most
stringent constraints on the diagonal NSI are found to come from neutrino
oscillation and scattering experiments, while the off-diagonal NSI are mostly
constrained by low-energy processes, such as atomic parity violation and cLFV.
We also comment on the future sensitivity of these models in long-baseline
experiments, such as DUNE.

impacts with a well-monitored subset of the human population to exclude a
region bounded by $\sigma_X \geq 10^{-8} - 10^{-7}$ cm$^2$ and $M_X < 50$ kg.
Our results open a new window on dark matter: the human body as a dark matter
detector.

TUS (Tracking Ultraviolet Set-up) is the world's first orbital detector of
ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). It was launched into orbit on 28th
April 2016 as a part of the scientific payload of the Lomonosov satellite. The
main aim of the mission was to test the technique of measuring the ultraviolet
fluorescence and Cherenkov radiation of extensive air showers (EASs) generated
by primary cosmic rays with energies above ~100 EeV in the Earth atmosphere
from space. During its operation period, TUS registered almost 80,000 events
with a few of them satisfying conditions anticipated for EASs initiated by
UHECRs. Here we discuss an event registered on 3rd October 2016. The event was
measured in perfect observation conditions as an ultraviolet track in the
nocturnal atmosphere of the Earth, with the kinematics and the light curve
similar to those expected from an EAS. A reconstruction of the arrival
direction and energy of a primary particle gave the zenith angle around
$44^\circ$ and the energy of the primary particle ~1000 EeV. The extreme energy
clearly is not compatible with the cosmic ray energy spectrum obtained with
ground-based experiments. We discuss all conditions of registering the event,
explain the reconstruction procedure and its limitations in details and comment
on possible astrophysical and anthropogenic sources of the signal. We believe
the measurement is important for the future missions KLYPVE-EUSO and POEMMA,
aimed for studying UHECRs from space.

Neutrinos could decay. Invisible neutrino decay modes are difficult to target
at laboratory experiments, and current bounds on such decays from solar
neutrino and neutrino oscillation experiments are somewhat weak. It has been
known for some time that Cosmology can serve as a powerful probe of invisible
neutrino decays. In this work, we show that in order for Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis to be successful, the invisible neutrino decay lifetime should
be $\tau_\nu > 10^{-3}\,\text{s}$. We revisit Cosmic Microwave Background
constraints on invisible neutrino decays, and by using the latest Planck
observations we find that neutrino lifetimes $\tau_\nu < (1.2-0.3)\times
10^{9}\,\text{s} \, \left({m_\nu}/{ 0.05\,\text{eV} }\right)^3$ are excluded at
$95\%$ CL. We show that this bound is robust to modifications of the
cosmological model, in particular that it is independent of the presence of
dark radiation. We find that typical invisible neutrino decay modes with rates
$\tau_\nu < 10^{5}\,\text{s}\, \left({m_\nu}/{ 0.05\,\text{eV} }\right)^3$ are
disfavoured at more than $5\,\sigma$ with respect to $\Lambda$CDM given the
latest Planck CMB observations. Finally, we show that when including
high-$\ell$ Planck polarization data, neutrino lifetimes $\tau_\nu =
(2-14)\times 10^{9}\,\text{s} \, \left({m_\nu}/{ 0.05\,\text{eV} }\right)^3$
are mildly preferred -- with a 1-2 $\sigma$ significance -- over neutrinos
being stable.

The LSND and MiniBooNE results as well as the reactor and Gallium anomalies
seem to indicate the presence of a sterile neutrino with a mass of $\sim 1$ eV
mixed with active neutrinos. Such sterile neutrino can be produced in the early
universe before the neutrino decoupling, leading to a contribution to the
effective number of neutrinos ($N_{eff}$) as well as to a contribution to the
sum of neutrino masses which are in tension with cosmological observations. We
propose a scenario to relax this tension by a Yukawa coupling of the sterile
neutrinos to ultra-light scalar particles which contribute to the dark matter
in the background. The coupling induces an effective mass for $\nu_s$ which
prevents its production in the early universe. We discuss the implications for
the upcoming KATRIN experiment and future relic neutrino search experiments
such as PTOLEMY. We also briefly comment on certain non-renormalizable forms of
interaction between $\nu_s$ and the scalar and their consequences for the
$\nu_s$ production in the early universe.

We study direct detection bounds on cosmic ray-upscattered dark matter in
simplified models including light mediators. We find that the energy dependence
in the scattering cross section is significant, and produces stronger bounds
than previously found (which assumed constant cross sections) by many orders of
magnitude at low DM mass. Finally, we compute the "neutrino-floor" that will
limit future direct detection searches for cosmic ray-upscattered dark matter.
While we focus on vector interactions for illustration, we emphasize that the
energy dependence is critical in determining accurate bounds on any particle
physics model of Dark Matter-CR interactions from experimental data on this
scenario.

Theoretical predictions for elastic neutrino-electron scattering have no
hadronic or nuclear uncertainties at leading order making this process an
important tool for normalizing neutrino flux. However, the process is subject
to large radiative corrections that differ according to experimental
conditions. In this paper, we collect new and existing results for total and
differential cross sections accompanied by radiation of one photon, $\nu e \to
\nu e (\gamma)$. We perform calculations within the Fermi effective theory and
provide analytic expressions for the electron energy spectrum and for the total
electromagnetic energy spectrum as well as for double- and triple-differential
cross sections w.r.t. electron energy, electron angle, photon energy, and
photon angle. We discuss illustrative applications to accelerator-based
neutrino experiments and provide the most precise up-to-date values of
neutrino-electron scattering cross sections. We present an analysis of
theoretical error, which is dominated by the $\sim 0.2 - 0.4\%$ uncertainty on
the hadronic correction.

We propose an experimental setup to observe coherent elastic neutrino-atom
scattering (CE$\nu$AS) using electron antineutrinos from tritium decay and a
liquid helium target. In this scattering process with the whole atom, that has
not beeen observed so far, the electrons tend to screen the weak charge of the
nucleus as seen by the electron antineutrino probe. The interference between
the nucleus and the electron cloud produces a sharp dip in the recoil spectrum
at atomic recoil energies of about 9 meV, reducing sizeably the number of
expected events with respect to the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus
scattering case. We estimate that with a 60 g tritium source surrounded by 500
kg of liquid helium in a cylindrical tank, one could observe the existence of
CE$\nu$AS processes at 3$\sigma$ in 5 years of data taking. Keeping the same
amount of helium and the same data-taking period, we test the sensitivity to
the Weinberg angle and a possible neutrino magnetic moment for three different
scenarios: 60 g, 160 g, and 500 g of tritium. In the latter scenario, the
Standard Model (SM) value of the Weinberg angle can be measured with a
statistical uncertainty of
$\sin^2{\vartheta_W^{\mathrm{SM}}}^{+0.015}_{-0.016}$. This would represent the
lowest-energy measurement of $\sin^2{\vartheta_W}$, with the advantage of being
not affected by the uncertainties on the neutron form factor of the nucleus as
the current lowest-energy determination. Finally, we study the sensitivity of
this apparatus to a possible electron neutrino magnetic moment and we find that
using 60 g of tritium it is possible to set an upper limit of about
$7\times10^{-13}\,\mu_B$ at 90% C.L., that is more than one order of magnitude
smaller than the current experimental limit.

We search for transient variations of the fine structure constant using data
from a European network of fiber-linked optical atomic clocks. By searching for
coherent variations in the recorded clock frequency comparisons across the
network, we significantly improve the constraints on transient variations of
the fine structure constant. For example, we constrain the variation in alpha
to <5*10^-17 for transients of duration 10^3 s. This analysis also presents a
possibility to search for dark matter, the mysterious substance hypothesised to
explain galaxy dynamics and other astrophysical phenomena that is thought to
dominate the matter density of the universe. At the current sensitivity level,
we find no evidence for dark matter in the form of topological defects (or,
more generally, any macroscopic objects), and we thus place constraints on
certain potential couplings between the dark matter and standard model
particles, substantially improving upon the existing constraints, particularly
for large (>~10^4 km) objects.

follow surprisingly simply and the CP violating phase can also be trivially
determined. Then, to avoid the cumbersome expressions for the exact
eigenvalues, we have applied previously derived perturbatively approximate
eigenvalues to this scheme and found it to be incredibly precise. We also find
that these eigenvalues converge at a rate of five orders of magnitude which is

Beam neutrino oscillation experiments typically employ only one detector at a
certain baseline, apart from the near detector that measures the unoscillated
neutrino flux at the source. Lately, there have been discussions of having
detectors at two different baselines in one of the future long-baseline
neutrino oscillation experiments. We study the potential advantage of a general
dual-baseline system and perform analysis with a specific example of the
envisioned T2HKK experiment. We introduce a new parameter to exploit the
correlation between the oscillations at both baselines, and show how it can
help in determining the mass hierarchy and the CP phase in the neutrino sector.
Our study and findings can be generically used for any dual-baseline system.

Non-standard neutrino self interactions (NSSI) could be stronger than Fermi
interactions. We investigate the ability to constrain these four-neutrino
interactions by their effect on the flux of neutrinos originating from a
galactic supernova. In the dense medium of a core collapse supernova, these new
self interactions can have a significant impact on neutrino oscillations,
leading to changes at the flavor evolution and spectra level. We use
simulations of the neutrino flux from a 13 solar mass, core collapse supernova
at 10 kpc away, and numerically propagate these neutrinos through the stellar
medium taking into account vacuum/MSW oscillations, SM $\nu-\nu$ scattering as
well as $\nu-\nu$ interactions that arise from NSSI. We pass the resulting
neutrino flux to a simulation of the future Hyper-Kamiokande detector to see
what constraints on NSSI parameters are possible when the next galactic
supernova becomes visible. We find that these constraints depend strongly on
the neutrino mass hierarchy and if the NSSI is flavor-violating or preserving.
Sensitivity to NSSI in the normal hierarchy (NH) at Hyper-K is limited by the
experiment's ability to efficiently detect $\nu_{e}$, but deviations from no
NSSI could be seen if the NSSI is particularly strong. In the inverted
hierarchy (IH) scenario, Hyper-K can significantly improve constraints on
flavor-violating NSSI down to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})G_{F}$.

Quasi-Dirac neutrinos are obtained when the Lagrangian density of a neutrino
mass model contains both Dirac and Majorana mass terms, and the Majorana terms
are sufficiently small. This type of neutrinos introduces new mixing angles and
mass splittings into the Hamiltonian, which will modify the standard neutrino
oscillation probabilities. In this paper, we focus on the case where the new
mass splittings are too small to be measured, but new angles and phases are
present. We perform a sensitivity study for this scenario for the upcoming
experiments DUNE and JUNO, finding that they will improve current bounds on the
relevant parameters. Finally, we also explore the discovery potential of both
experiments, assuming that neutrinos are indeed quasi-Dirac particles.

The gallium anomaly, i.e. the missing electron-neutrino flux from $^{37}$Ar
and $^{51}$Cr electron-capture decays as measured by the GALLEX and SAGE
solar-neutrino detectors, has been among us already for about two decades. We
present here a new estimate of the significance of this anomaly based on
cross-section calculations using nuclear shell-model wave functions obtained by
exploiting recently developed two-nucleon interactions. The gallium anomaly of
the GALLEX and SAGE experiments is found to be smaller than that obtained in
previous evaluations, decreasing the significance from 3.0$\sigma$ to
2.3$\sigma$. This result is compatible with the recent indication in favor of
short-baseline $\bar\nu_{e}$ disappearance due to small active-sterile neutrino
mixing obtained from the combined analysis of the data of the NEOS and DANSS

We propose a novel strategy to search for new physics in timing spectra,
envisioning the situation in which a new particle comes from the decay of its
heavier partner with a finite particle width. The timing distribution of events
induced by the dark matter particle scattering at the detector may populate in
a relatively narrow range, forming a "resonance-like" shape. Due to this
structural feature, the signal may be isolated from the backgrounds, in
particular when the backgrounds are uniformly distributed in energy and time.
For proof of the principle, we investigate the discovery potential for dark
matter from the decay of a dark photon in the COHERENT experiment, and show the
exciting prospects for exploring the associated parameter space with this
experiment. We analyze the existing CsI detector data with a timing cut and an
energy cut, and find, for the first time, an excess in the timing distribution
which can be explained by such dark matter. We compare the sensitivity to the
kinetic mixing parameter ($\epsilon$) for current and future COHERENT
experiments with the projected limits from LDMX and DUNE.

While the low-energy excess observed at MiniBooNE remains unchallenged, it
has become increasingly difficult to reconcile it with the results from other
sterile neutrino searches and cosmology. Recently, it has been shown that
non-minimal models with new particles in a hidden sector could provide a better
fit to the data. As their main ingredients they require a GeV-scale $Z'$,
kinetically mixed with the photon, and an unstable heavy neutrino with a mass
in the 150 MeV range that mixes with the light neutrinos. In this letter we
point out that atmospheric neutrino experiments (and, in particular,
IceCube/DeepCore) could probe a significant fraction of the parameter space of
such models by looking for an excess of "double-bang" events at low energies,
as proposed in our previous work (arXiv:1707.08573). Such a search would probe
exactly the same production and decay mechanisms required to explain the
anomaly.

We examine the compatibility between the Neutrino Option, in which the
electroweak scale is generated by PeV mass type I seesaw Majorana neutrinos,
and leptogenesis. We find the Neutrino Option is consistent with resonant
leptogenesis. Working within the minimal seesaw scenario with two heavy
Majorana neutrinos $N_{1,2}$, which form a pseudo-Dirac pair, we explore the
viable parameter space. We find that the Neutrino Option and successful
leptogenesis are compatible in the cases of a neutrino mass spectrum with
normal (inverted) ordering for $1.2 \times 10^6 < M \text{ (GeV)} < 8.8 \times
10^6$ ($2.4 \times 10^6 < M \text{ (GeV)} < 7.4 \times 10^6$), with $M = (M_1 +
M_2)/2$ and $M_{1,2}$ the masses of $N_{1,2}$. Successful leptogenesis requires
that $\Delta M/M \equiv (M_2 - M_1)/M \sim 10^{-8}$. We further show that
leptogenesis can produce the baryon asymmetry of the Universe within the
Neutrino Option scenario when the requisite CP violation in leptogenesis is
provided exclusively by the Dirac or Majorana low energy CP violation phases of
the PMNS matrix.

Imaging the immediate vicinity of supermassive black holes (SMBH) and
extracting a BH-spin signature is one of the grand challenges in astrophysics.
M87 is known as one of the best targets for imaging the BH shadow and it can be
partially thick against synchrotron self-absorption (SSA), particularly in a
flaring state with high mass accretion rate. However, little is known about
influences of the SSA-thick region on BH shadow images. Here we investigate BH
shadow images of M87 at 230 GHz properly taking into account the SSA-thick
region. When the BH has a high spin value, the corresponding BH shadow image
shows the positional offset between the center of the photon ring and that of
the SSA-thick ring at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) due to the
frame-dragging effect in the Kerr spacetime. As a result, we find that a
dark-crescent structure is generally produced between the photon ring and the
SSA-thick ISCO ring in the BH shadow image. The scale size of the dark-crescent
increase with BH spin: its width reaches up to $\sim 2$ gravitational radius
when the BH spin is 99.8% of its maximum value. The dark crescent is regarded
as a new signature of a highly spinning BH. This feature is expected to appear
in flaring states with relatively high mass accretion rate rather than the
quiescent states. We have simulated the image reconstruction of our theoretical
image by assuming the current and future Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) array,
and have found that the future EHT including space-very long baseline
interferometry in 2020s can detect the dark crescent.

Neutrino capture on beta-decaying nuclei is currently the only known
potentially viable method of detection of cosmic background neutrinos. It is
based on the idea of separation of the spectra of electrons or positrons
produced in captures of relic neutrinos on unstable nuclei from those from the
usual $\beta$-decay and requires very high energy resolution of the detector,
comparable to the neutrino mass. In this paper we suggest an alternative method
of discrimination between neutrino capture and $\beta$-decay, based on periodic
variations of angular correlations in inverse beta decay transitions induced by
relic neutrino capture. The time variations are expected to arise due to the
peculiar motion of the Sun with respect to the C$\nu$B rest frame and the
rotation of the Earth about its axis and can be observed in experiments with
both polarized and unpolarized nuclear targets. The main advantage of the
suggested method is that it does not depend crucially on the energy resolution
of detection of the produced $\beta$-particles and can be operative even if
this resolution exceeds the largest neutrino mass.

There is a well known 2$\sigma$ tension in the measurements of the solar
$\Delta m^2$ between KamLAND and SNO/Super-KamioKANDE. Precise determination of
the solar $\Delta m^2$ is especially important in connection with current and
future long baseline CP violation measurements. Reference \cite{Seo:2018rrb}
points out that currently running short baseline reactor neutrino experiments,
Daya Bay and RENO, can also constrain solar $\Delta m^2$ value as demonstrated
by a GLoBES simulation with a limited systematic uncertainty consideration. In
this work, the publicly available data, from Daya Bay (1,958 days) and RENO
(2,200 days) are used to constrain the solar $\Delta m^2$. Verification of our
method through $\Delta m^2_{ee}$ and $\sin^2 \theta_{13}$ measurements is
discussed in Appendix A. Using this verified method, reasonable constraints on
the solar $\Delta m^2$ are obtained using above Daya Bay and RENO data, both
individually and combined. We find that the combined data of Daya Bay and RENO
set an upper limit on the solar $\Delta m^2$ of 18 $\times 10^{-5}$ eV$^2$ at
the 95% C.L., including both systematic and statistical uncertainties. This
constraint is slightly more than twice the KamLAND value. As this combined
result is still statistics limited, even though driven by Daya Bay data, the
constraint will improve with the additional running of this experiment.

The Borexino detector measures solar neutrino fluxes via neutrino-electron
elastic scattering. Observed spectra are determined by the solar-$\nu_{e}$
survival probability $P_{ee}(E)$, and the chiral couplings of the neutrino and
electron. Some theories of physics beyond the Standard Model postulate the
existence of Non-Standard Interactions (NSI's) which modify the chiral
couplings and $P_{ee}(E)$. In this paper, we search for such NSI's, in
particularly neutral-current-like interactions that modify the $\nu_e - e$ and
$\nu_\tau - e$ couplings, using Borexino Phase II data. Standard Solar Model
predictions of the solar neutrino fluxes for both high- and low-metallicity
assumptions are considered. No indication of new physics is found at the level
of sensitivity of the detector and constraints on the parameters of the NSI's
are placed. In addition, with the same dataset the value of $\sin^2\theta_W$ is
obtained with a precision comparable to that achieved in reactor antineutrino
experiments.

We extend a simple and compact method for calculating the three flavor
neutrino oscillation probabilities in uniform matter density to schemes with
sterile neutrinos, with favorable features inherited. The only constraint of
the extended method is that the scale of the matter potential is not
significantly larger than the atmospheric $\Delta m^2$, which is satisfied by
all the running and proposed accelerator oscillation experiments. Degeneracy of
the zeroth order eigensystem around solar and atmospheric resonances are
resolved. Corrections to the zeroth order results are restricted to no larger
than the ratio of the solar to the atmospheric $\Delta m^2$. The zeroth order
expressions are exact in vacuum because all the higher order corrections vanish
when the matter potential is set zero. Also because all the corrections are
continuous functions of matter potential, the zeroth order precision is much
better than $\Delta m^2_\odot/\Delta m^2_\text{atm}$ for weak matter effect.
Numerical tests are presented to verify the theoretical predictions of the
exceptional features. Moreover, possible applications of the method in
experiments to check the existence of sterile neutrinos are discussed.

Neutrinos may acquire small Dirac or Majorana masses by new low-energy
physics in terms of the chiral gravitational anomaly, as proposed by Dvali and
Funcke (2016). This model predicts fast neutrino decays, $\nu_i\to\nu_j+\phi$
and $\nu_i\to\overline{\nu}_j+\phi$, where the gravi-majorons $\phi$ are
pseudoscalar Nambu-Goldstone bosons. The final-state neutrino and antineutrino
distributions differ depending on the Dirac or Majorana mass of the initial
state. This opens a channel for distinguishing these cases, for example in the
spectrum of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. In passing, we put strong
bounds on the decay of the heaviest neutrino to a light pseudoscalar,
${\tau_3}/{m_3}> 2.2\times 10^{-5}{{\rm s}}/{{\rm eV}}$ at 90% CL, using data
from experiments searching for antineutrino appearance from the Sun.

Quantum computing technologies promise to revolutionize calculations in many
areas of physics, chemistry, and data science. Their power is expected to be
especially pronounced for problems where direct analogs of a quantum system
under study can be encoded coherently within a quantum computer. A first step
toward harnessing this power is to express the building blocks of known
physical systems within the language of quantum gates and circuits. In this
paper, we present a quantum calculation of an archetypal quantum system:
neutrino oscillations. We define gate arrangements that implement the neutral
lepton mixing operation and neutrino time evolution in two-, three-, and
four-flavor systems. We then calculate oscillation probabilities by coherently
preparing quantum states within the processor, time evolving them unitarily,
and performing measurements in the flavor basis, with close analogy to the
physical processes realized in neutrino oscillation experiments, finding
excellent agreement with classical calculations. We provide recipes for
modeling oscillation in the standard three-flavor paradigm as well as
beyond-standard-model scenarios, including systems with sterile neutrinos,
non-standard interactions, Lorentz symmetry violation, and anomalous
decoherence.

Unitarity of the $3\times 3$ lepton flavor mixing matrix $V$ is unavoidably
violated in a seesaw mechanism if its new heavy degrees of freedom are slightly
mixed with the active neutrino flavors. We propose to use the atomic transition
process ${\left| \rm e \right> \to\left|\rm g \right> + \gamma + \nu^{}_{i} +
\overline{\nu}^{}_{j}}$ (for $i, j = 1, 2, 3$), where $\left|\rm e \right>$ and
$\left|\rm g \right>$ stand respectively for the excited and ground levels of
an atomic system, to probe or constrain the unitarity-violating effects of $V$.
We find that the photon spectrum of this transition will be distorted by the
effects of $V V^\dagger \neq {\bf 1}$ and $V^\dagger V \neq {\bf 1}$ as
compared with the $V V^\dagger = V^\dagger V = {\bf 1}$ case. We locate certain
frequencies in the photon spectrum to minimize the degeneracy of effects of the
unitarity violation and uncertainties of the flavor mixing parameters
themselves. The requirements of a nominal experimental setup to test the
unitarity of $V$ are briefly discussed.

Excess (GCE) originates largely from point sources, and not from annihilating

identifying the true origin of the GCE using non-Poissonian template fitting
(NPTF) methods. In a proof-of-principle example with simulated data, we
discover that unmodeled sources in the Fermi Bubbles can lead to a dark matter
signal being misattributed to point sources by the NPTF. We discover striking
behavior consistent with a mismodeling effect in the real Fermi data, finding
that large artificial injected dark matter signals are completely misattributed

Atmospheric neutrinos at low energies, $E \lsim 500$ MeV, is known to be a
rich source of information of lepton mixing parameters. We formulate a simple
perturbative framework to elucidate the characteristic features of neutrino
oscillation at around the solar-scale enhancement due to the matter effect. The
clearest message we could extract from our perturbation theory is that CP
violation in the appearance oscillation probability is large, a factor of $\sim
10$ times larger than CP violation at around the atmospheric-scale oscillation
maximum. Underlying mechanism for it is that one of the suppression factors on
the CP phase dependent terms due to smallness of $\Delta m^2_{21} / \Delta
m^2_{31}$ are dynamically lifted by the solar-scale enhancement. Our framework
has a unique feature as a perturbation theory in which large $\Delta m^2_{31}$
term outside the key 1-2 sector for the solar-scale resonance does not yield
sizeable corrections. On the contrary, the larger the $\Delta m^2_{31}$, the
smaller the higher order corrections.

We explore the capabilities of the upcoming Deep Underground Neutrino
Experiment (DUNE) to measure $\nu_\tau$ charged-current interactions and the
associated oscillation probability $P(\nu_\mu \to \nu_\tau)$ at its far
detector, concentrating on how such results can be used to probe neutrino
properties and interactions. DUNE has the potential to identify significantly
more $\nu_\tau$ events than all existing experiments and can use this data
sample to nontrivially test the three-massive-neutrinos paradigm by providing
complementary measurements to those from the $\nu_e$ appearance and $\nu_\mu$
disappearance channels. We further discuss the sensitivity of the $\nu_\tau$
appearance channel to several hypotheses for the physics that may lurk beyond
the three-massive-neutrinos paradigm: a non-unitary lepton mixing matrix, the

Neutrinos produced in extragalactic sources may experience
flavor-oscillations and decoherence on their way to Earth due to their
interaction with dark matter (DM). As a result, they may be detected in
pointer-states other than the flavor states at the source. The oscillation
pattern and the structure of the pointer-states can give us information on the
characteristics of the DM and the kind of interaction that has taken place.
From this perspective, neutrinos can be viewed as DM-tracers. We study the
local evolution of neutrino flavor-eigenstates due to local effects produced by
the presence of DM. To explore the sensitivity of the model, we consider
different DM density profiles, masses and interactions. Starting from the
eigenstates of the neutrino-mass Hamiltonian, we construct the flavor-states
with the neutrino mixing-matrix in vacuum. We then include local interactions
with DM, acting along the neutrino path towards the Earth, and analyse the
resulting probabilities. In doing so, we adopt different DM density profiles,
e.g. a constant, a local isotropic and a Navarro-Frenk-White density
distribution. Finally, by following the time evolution of the flavor-states, we
identify pointer-states and interpret the results in terms of the adopted DM
model. Due to the interaction with DM, neutrinos experience the MSW effect, the
extent of which depends on the DM density profile. The interaction with DM
produces the enhancement or suppression of oscillations. Decoherence effects
may take place. We model the time evolution of extragalactic neutrino
flavor-states by letting them interact with DM. The features of the calculated
response seem to support the notion that these neutrinos can be taken as DM
tracers. From a theoretical point of view, the coexistence and/or competition
of decoherence and MSW effects is sustained by the results.

Heavy neutrinos were sought in pion decays $\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ \nu$ by
examining the observed muon energy spectrum for extra peaks in addition to the
expected peak for a massless neutrino. No evidence for heavy neutrinos was
observed. Upper limits were set on the neutrino mixing matrix $|U_{\mu i}|^2$
in the neutrino mass region of 15.7--33.8 MeV/c$^2$, improving on previous
results by an order of magnitude.

We propose to use the unique event topology and reconstruction capabilities
of liquid argon time projection chambers to study sub-GeV atmospheric
neutrinos. The detection of low energy recoiled protons in DUNE allows for a
determination of the leptonic $CP$-violating phase independent from the
accelerator neutrino measurement. Our findings indicate that this analysis can
exclude several values of $\delta_{CP}$ beyond the $3\sigma$ level. Moreover,
the determination of the sub-GeV atmospheric neutrino flux will have important
consequences in the detection of diffuse supernova neutrinos and in dark matter
experiments.

A natural realization of CPT violation in neutrino oscillation can arise due
to the coupling to a light scalar or vector dark matter (DM). The dark
non-standard interaction (NSI) is associated with the $\gamma_0$ matrix in
neutrino's effective propagator and hence corrects the neutrino Hamiltonian as
dark matter potential, in the same way as the ordinary matter effect. The
effect is, however, inversely proportional to the neutrino energy and hence
appears as a correction to the neutrino mass squared. Due to a sign difference
in the corrections for neutrino and anti-neutrino modes, the neutrino
oscillation receives CPT violation from the dark NSI. Seeing difference in the
neutrino and anti-neutrino mass squared differences not necessarily leads to
the conclusion of CPT symmetry breaking in the fundamental Lagrangian but can
indicate light DM and its coupling with neutrinos.

Reconstructions of the primordial power spectrum (PPS) of curvature
perturbations from cosmic microwave background anisotropies and large-scale
structure data suggest that the usually assumed power-law PPS has localised
features (up to $\sim 10\%$ in amplitude), although of only marginal
significance in the framework of $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. On the other hand if
the underlying cosmology is assumed to be Einstein-de Sitter, larger features
in the PPS (up to $\sim 20\%$) are required to accurately fit the observed
acoustic peaks. Within the context of single clock inflation, we show that any
given reconstruction of the PPS can be mapped on to functional parameters of
the underlying effective theory of the adiabatic mode within a 2nd-order
formalism, provided the best fit fractional change of the PPS,
$\Delta\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}/\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}$ is such that
$(\Delta\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}/\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R})^3$ falls within the
$1\,\sigma$ confidence interval of the reconstruction for features induced by
variations of either the sound speed $c_\mathrm{s}$ or the slow-roll parameter
$\epsilon$. Although there is a degeneracy amongst these functional parameters
(and the models that project onto them), we can identify simple representative
inflationary models that yield such features in the PPS. Thus we provide a
dictionary (more accurately, a thesaurus) to go from observational data, via
the reconstructed PPS, to models that reproduce them to per cent level
precision.

The cosmic-ray Sun shadow, which is caused by high-energy charged cosmic rays
being blocked and deflected by the Sun and its magnetic field, has been
observed by various experiments such as Argo-YBJ, HAWC, Tibet, and IceCube.
Most notably, the shadow's size and depth was recently shown to correlate with
the 11-year solar cycle. The interpretation of such measurements, which help to
bridge the gap between solar physics and high-energy particle astrophysics,
requires a solid theoretical understanding of cosmic-ray propagation in the
coronal magnetic field. It is the aim of this paper to establish theoretical
predictions for the cosmic-ray Sun shadow in order to identify observables that
can be used to study this link in more detail. To determine the cosmic-ray Sun
shadow, we numerically compute trajectories of charged cosmic rays in the
energy range of 5 to 316 TeV for five different mass numbers. We present and
analyse the resulting shadow images for protons and iron, as well as for
typically measured cosmic-ray compositions. We confirm the observationally
established correlation between the magnitude of the shadowing effect and both
the mean sunspot number and the polarity of the magnetic field during the solar
cycle. We also show that during low solar activity, the Sun's shadow behaves
similarly to that of a dipole, for which we find a non-monotonous dependence on
energy. In particular, the shadow can become significantly more pronounced than
the geometrical disk expected for a totally unmagnetized Sun. For times of high
solar activity, we instead predict the shadow to depend monotonously on energy,
and to be generally weaker than the geometrical shadow for all tested energies.
These effects should become visible in energy-resolved measurements of the Sun
shadow, and may in the future become an independent measure for the level of
disorder in the solar magnetic field.
