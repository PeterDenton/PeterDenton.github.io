<div class="abstract" style="display:none;"><br>
We examine the compatibility between the Neutrino Option, in which the
electroweak scale is generated by PeV mass type I seesaw Majorana neutrinos,
and leptogenesis. We find the Neutrino Option is consistent with resonant
leptogenesis. Working within the minimal seesaw scenario with two heavy
Majorana neutrinos $N_{1,2}$, which form a pseudo-Dirac pair, we explore the
viable parameter space. We find that the Neutrino Option and successful
leptogenesis are compatible in the cases of a neutrino mass spectrum with
normal (inverted) ordering for $1.2 \times 10^6 < M \text{ (GeV)} < 8.8 \times
10^6$ ($2.4 \times 10^6 < M \text{ (GeV)} < 7.4 \times 10^6$), with $M = (M_1 +
M_2)/2$ and $M_{1,2}$ the masses of $N_{1,2}$. Successful leptogenesis requires
that $\Delta M/M \equiv (M_2 - M_1)/M \sim 10^{-8}$. We further show that
leptogenesis can produce the baryon asymmetry of the Universe within the
Neutrino Option scenario when the requisite CP violation in leptogenesis is
provided exclusively by the Dirac or Majorana low energy CP violation phases of
the PMNS matrix.

Imaging the immediate vicinity of supermassive black holes (SMBH) and
extracting a BH-spin signature is one of the grand challenges in astrophysics.
M87 is known as one of the best targets for imaging the BH shadow and it can be
partially thick against synchrotron self-absorption (SSA), particularly in a
flaring state with high mass accretion rate. However, little is known about
influences of the SSA-thick region on BH shadow images. Here we investigate BH
shadow images of M87 at 230 GHz properly taking into account the SSA-thick
region. When the BH has a high spin value, the corresponding BH shadow image
shows the positional offset between the center of the photon ring and that of
the SSA-thick ring at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) due to the
frame-dragging effect in the Kerr spacetime. As a result, we find that a
dark-crescent structure is generally produced between the photon ring and the
SSA-thick ISCO ring in the BH shadow image. The scale size of the dark-crescent
increase with BH spin: its width reaches up to $\sim 2$ gravitational radius
when the BH spin is 99.8% of its maximum value. The dark crescent is regarded
as a new signature of a highly spinning BH. This feature is expected to appear
in flaring states with relatively high mass accretion rate rather than the
quiescent states. We have simulated the image reconstruction of our theoretical
image by assuming the current and future Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) array,
and have found that the future EHT including space-very long baseline
interferometry in 2020s can detect the dark crescent.

Neutrino capture on beta-decaying nuclei is currently the only known
potentially viable method of detection of cosmic background neutrinos. It is
based on the idea of separation of the spectra of electrons or positrons
produced in captures of relic neutrinos on unstable nuclei from those from the
usual $\beta$-decay and requires very high energy resolution of the detector,
comparable to the neutrino mass. In this paper we suggest an alternative method
of discrimination between neutrino capture and $\beta$-decay, based on periodic
variations of angular correlations in inverse beta decay transitions induced by
relic neutrino capture. The time variations are expected to arise due to the
peculiar motion of the Sun with respect to the C$\nu$B rest frame and the
rotation of the Earth about its axis and can be observed in experiments with
both polarized and unpolarized nuclear targets. The main advantage of the
suggested method is that it does not depend crucially on the energy resolution
of detection of the produced $\beta$-particles and can be operative even if
this resolution exceeds the largest neutrino mass.

There is a well known 2$\sigma$ tension in the measurements of the solar
$\Delta m^2$ between KamLAND and SNO/Super-K. Precise determination of the
solar $\Delta m^2$ is especially important in connection with current and
future long baseline CP violation measurements. Reference~\cite{Seo:2018rrb}
points out that currently running short baseline reactor neutrino experiments,
Daya Bay and RENO, can also constrain solar $\Delta m^2$ value as demonstrated
by a GLoBES simulation with a limited systematic uncertainty consideration. In
this work, the publicly available data, from Daya Bay (1,958 days) and RENO
(2,200 days) are used to constrain the solar $\Delta m^2$. Verification of our
method through $\Delta m^2_{ee}$ and $\sin^2 \theta_{13}$ measurements is
discussed in Appendix A. Using this verified method, reasonable constraints on
the solar $\Delta m^2$ are obtained using the current publicly available Daya
Bay and RENO data, both individually and combined. We find that the combined
data of Daya Bay and RENO set an upper limit on the Solar $\Delta m^2$ of 17
$\times 10^{-5}$ eV$^2$ at the 95\% C.L., including both systematic and
statistical uncertainties. This constraint is slightly more than twice the
KamLAND value. As this combined result is still statistics limited, even though
driven by Daya Bay data, the constraint will improve with the additional
running of this experiment.

We perform a global analysis of neutrino data in the framework of three
massive neutrinos with non-standard neutrino interactions which affect their
evolution in the matter background. We focus on the effect of NSI in the
present observables sensitive to leptonic CP violation and to the mass
ordering. We consider complex neutral current neutrino interactions with quarks
whose lepton-flavor structure is independent of the quark type. We quantify the
status of the "hints" for CP violation, the mass-ordering and non-maximality of
$\theta_{23}$ in these scenarios. We also present a parametrization-invariant
formalism for leptonic CP violation in presence of a generalized matter
potential induced by NSI.

The Borexino detector measures solar neutrino fluxes via neutrino-electron
elastic scattering. Observed spectra are determined by the solar-$\nu_{e}$
survival probability $P_{ee}(E)$, and the chiral couplings of the neutrino and
electron. Some theories of physics beyond the Standard Model postulate the
existence of Non-Standard Interactions (NSI's) which modify the chiral
couplings and $P_{ee}(E)$. In this paper, we search for such NSI's, in
particularly neutral-current-like interactions that modify the $\nu_e - e$ and
$\nu_\tau - e$ couplings, using Borexino Phase II data. Standard Solar Model
predictions of the solar neutrino fluxes for both high- and low-metallicity
assumptions are considered. No indication of new physics is found at the level
of sensitivity of the detector and constraints on the parameters of the NSI's
are placed. In addition, with the same dataset the value of $\sin^2\theta_W$ is
obtained with a precision comparable to that achieved in reactor antineutrino
experiments.

We explore the complementarity between terrestrial neutrino oscillation
experiments and astrophysical/cosmological measurements in probing the
existence of sterile neutrinos. We find that upcoming accelerator neutrino
experiments will not improve on constraints by the time they are operational,
but that reactor experiments can already probe parameter space beyond the reach
of Planck. We emphasize the tension between cosmological experiments and

resolving this tension.

We extend a simple and compact method for calculating the three flavor
neutrino oscillation probabilities in uniform matter density to schemes with
sterile neutrinos, with favorable features inherited. The only constraint of
the extended method is that the scale of the matter potential is not
significantly larger than the atmospheric $\Delta m^2$, which is satisfied by
all the running and proposed accelerator oscillation experiments. Degeneracy of
the zeroth order eigensystem around solar and atmospheric resonances are
resolved. Corrections to the zeroth order results are restricted to no larger
than the ratio of the solar to the atmospheric $\Delta m^2$. The zeroth order
expressions are exact in vacuum because all the higher order corrections vanish
when the matter potential is set zero. Also because all the corrections are
continuous functions of matter potential, the zeroth order precision is much
better than $\Delta m^2_\odot/\Delta m^2_\text{atm}$ for weak matter effect.
Numerical tests are presented to verify the theoretical predictions of the
exceptional features. Moreover, possible applications of the method in
experiments to check the existence of sterile neutrinos are discussed.

Neutrinos may acquire small Dirac or Majorana masses by new low-energy
physics in terms of the chiral gravitational anomaly, as proposed by Dvali and
Funcke (2016). This model predicts fast neutrino decays, $\nu_i\to\nu_j+\phi$
and $\nu_i\to\overline{\nu}_j+\phi$, where the gravi-majorons $\phi$ are
pseudoscalar Nambu-Goldstone bosons. The final-state neutrino and antineutrino
distributions differ depending on the Dirac or Majorana mass of the initial
state. This opens a channel for distinguishing these cases, for example in the
spectrum of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. In passing, we put strong
bounds on the decay of the heaviest neutrino to a light pseudoscalar,
${\tau_3}/{m_3}> 2.2\times 10^{-5}{{\rm s}}/{{\rm eV}}$ at 90% CL, using data
from experiments searching for antineutrino appearance from the Sun.

Quantum computing technologies promise to revolutionize calculations in many
areas of physics, chemistry, and data science. Their power is expected to be
especially pronounced for problems where direct analogs of a quantum system
under study can be encoded coherently within a quantum computer. A first step
toward harnessing this power is to express the building blocks of known
physical systems within the language of quantum gates and circuits. In this
paper, we present a quantum calculation of an archetypal quantum system:
neutrino oscillations. We define gate arrangements that implement the neutral
lepton mixing operation and neutrino time evolution in two-, three-, and
four-flavor systems. We then calculate oscillation probabilities by coherently
preparing quantum states within the processor, time evolving them unitarily,
and performing measurements in the flavor basis, with close analogy to the
physical processes realized in neutrino oscillation experiments, finding
excellent agreement with classical calculations. We provide recipes for
modeling oscillation in the standard three-flavor paradigm as well as
beyond-standard-model scenarios, including systems with sterile neutrinos,
non-standard interactions, Lorentz symmetry violation, and anomalous
decoherence.

Unitarity of the $3\times 3$ lepton flavor mixing matrix $V$ is unavoidably
violated in a seesaw mechanism if its new heavy degrees of freedom are slightly
mixed with the active neutrino flavors. We propose to use the atomic transition
process ${\left| \rm e \right> \to\left|\rm g \right> + \gamma + \nu^{}_{i} +
\overline{\nu}^{}_{j}}$ (for $i, j = 1, 2, 3$), where $\left|\rm e \right>$ and
$\left|\rm g \right>$ stand respectively for the excited and ground levels of
an atomic system, to probe or constrain the unitarity-violating effects of $V$.
We find that the photon spectrum of this transition will be distorted by the
effects of $V V^\dagger \neq {\bf 1}$ and $V^\dagger V \neq {\bf 1}$ as
compared with the $V V^\dagger = V^\dagger V = {\bf 1}$ case. We locate certain
frequencies in the photon spectrum to minimize the degeneracy of effects of the
unitarity violation and uncertainties of the flavor mixing parameters
themselves. The requirements of a nominal experimental setup to test the
unitarity of $V$ are briefly discussed.

Statistical evidence has previously suggested that the Galactic Center GeV
Excess (GCE) originates largely from point sources, and not from annihilating
dark matter. We examine the impact of unmodeled source populations on
identifying the true origin of the GCE using non-Poissonian template fitting
(NPTF) methods. In a proof-of-principle example with simulated data, we
discover that unmodeled sources in the Fermi Bubbles can lead to a dark matter
signal being misattributed to point sources by the NPTF. We discover striking
behavior consistent with a mismodeling effect in the real Fermi data, finding
that large artificial injected dark matter signals are completely misattributed
to point sources. Consequently, we conclude that dark matter may provide a

Atmospheric neutrinos at low energies, $E \lsim 500$ MeV, is known to be a
rich source of information of lepton mixing parameters. We formulate a simple
perturbative framework to elucidate the characteristic features of neutrino
oscillation at around the solar-scale enhancement due to the matter effect. The
clearest message we could extract from our perturbation theory is that CP
violation in the appearance oscillation probability is large, a factor of $\sim
10$ times larger than CP violation at around the atmospheric-scale oscillation
maximum. Underlying mechanism for it is that one of the suppression factors on
the CP phase dependent terms due to smallness of $\Delta m^2_{21} / \Delta
m^2_{31}$ are dynamically lifted by the solar-scale enhancement. Our framework
has a unique feature as a perturbation theory in which large $\Delta m^2_{31}$
term outside the key 1-2 sector for the solar-scale resonance does not yield
sizeable corrections. On the contrary, the larger the $\Delta m^2_{31}$, the
smaller the higher order corrections.

We explore the capabilities of the upcoming Deep Underground Neutrino
Experiment (DUNE) to measure $\nu_\tau$ charged-current interactions and the
associated oscillation probability $P(\nu_\mu \to \nu_\tau)$ at its far
detector, concentrating on how such results can be used to probe neutrino
properties and interactions. DUNE has the potential to identify significantly
more $\nu_\tau$ events than all existing experiments and can use this data
sample to nontrivially test the three-massive-neutrinos paradigm by providing
complementary measurements to those from the $\nu_e$ appearance and $\nu_\mu$
disappearance channels. We further discuss the sensitivity of the $\nu_\tau$
appearance channel to several hypotheses for the physics that may lurk beyond
the three-massive-neutrinos paradigm: a non-unitary lepton mixing matrix, the
$3+1$ light neutrinos hypothesis, and the existence of non-standard
neutral-current neutrino interactions. Throughout, we also consider the
relative benefits of the proposed high-energy tune of the Long-Baseline

Neutrinos produced in extragalactic sources may experience
flavor-oscillations and decoherence on their way to Earth due to their
interaction with dark matter (DM). As a result, they may be detected in
pointer-states other than the flavor states at the source. The oscillation
pattern and the structure of the pointer-states can give us information on the
characteristics of the DM and the kind of interaction that has taken place.
From this perspective, neutrinos can be viewed as DM-tracers. We study the
local evolution of neutrino flavor-eigenstates due to local effects produced by
the presence of DM. To explore the sensitivity of the model, we consider
different DM density profiles, masses and interactions. Starting from the
eigenstates of the neutrino-mass Hamiltonian, we construct the flavor-states
with the neutrino mixing-matrix in vacuum. We then include local interactions
with DM, acting along the neutrino path towards the Earth, and analyse the
resulting probabilities. In doing so, we adopt different DM density profiles,
e.g. a constant, a local isotropic and a Navarro-Frenk-White density
distribution. Finally, by following the time evolution of the flavor-states, we
identify pointer-states and interpret the results in terms of the adopted DM
model. Due to the interaction with DM, neutrinos experience the MSW effect, the
extent of which depends on the DM density profile. The interaction with DM
produces the enhancement or suppression of oscillations. Decoherence effects
may take place. We model the time evolution of extragalactic neutrino
flavor-states by letting them interact with DM. The features of the calculated
response seem to support the notion that these neutrinos can be taken as DM
tracers. From a theoretical point of view, the coexistence and/or competition
of decoherence and MSW effects is sustained by the results.

Heavy neutrinos were sought in pion decays $\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ \nu$ by
examining the observed muon energy spectrum for extra peaks in addition to the
expected peak for a massless neutrino. No evidence for heavy neutrinos was
observed. Upper limits were set on the neutrino mixing matrix $|U_{\mu i}|^2$
in the neutrino mass region of 15.7--33.8 MeV/c$^2$, improving on previous
results by an order of magnitude.

We propose to use the unique event topology and reconstruction capabilities
of liquid argon time projection chambers to study sub-GeV atmospheric
neutrinos. The detection of low energy recoiled protons in DUNE allows for a
determination of the leptonic $CP$-violating phase independent from the
accelerator neutrino measurement. Our findings indicate that this analysis can
exclude several values of $\delta_{CP}$ beyond the $3\sigma$ level. Moreover,
the determination of the sub-GeV atmospheric neutrino flux will have important
consequences in the detection of diffuse supernova neutrinos and in dark matter
experiments.

A natural realization of CPT violation in neutrino oscillation can arise due
to the coupling to a light scalar or vector dark matter (DM). The dark
non-standard interaction (NSI) is associated with the $\gamma_0$ matrix in
neutrino's effective propagator and hence corrects the neutrino Hamiltonian as
dark matter potential, in the same way as the ordinary matter effect. The
effect is, however, inversely proportional to the neutrino energy and hence
appears as a correction to the neutrino mass squared. Due to a sign difference
in the corrections for neutrino and anti-neutrino modes, the neutrino
oscillation receives CPT violation from the dark NSI. Seeing difference in the
neutrino and anti-neutrino mass squared differences not necessarily leads to
the conclusion of CPT symmetry breaking in the fundamental Lagrangian but can
indicate light DM and its coupling with neutrinos.

Reconstructions of the primordial power spectrum (PPS) of curvature
perturbations from cosmic microwave background anisotropies and large-scale
structure data suggest that the usually assumed power-law PPS has localised
features (up to $\sim 10\%$ in amplitude), although of only marginal
significance in the framework of $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. On the other hand if
the underlying cosmology is assumed to be Einstein-de Sitter, larger features
in the PPS (up to $\sim 20\%$) are required to accurately fit the observed
acoustic peaks. Within the context of single clock inflation, we show that any
given reconstruction of the PPS can be mapped on to functional parameters of
the underlying effective theory of the adiabatic mode within a 2nd-order
formalism, provided the best fit fractional change of the PPS,
$\Delta\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}/\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}$ is such that
$(\Delta\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}/\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R})^3$ falls within the
$1\,\sigma$ confidence interval of the reconstruction for features induced by
variations of either the sound speed $c_\mathrm{s}$ or the slow-roll parameter
$\epsilon$. Although there is a degeneracy amongst these functional parameters
(and the models that project onto them), we can identify simple representative
inflationary models that yield such features in the PPS. Thus we provide a
dictionary (more accurately, a thesaurus) to go from observational data, via
the reconstructed PPS, to models that reproduce them to per cent level
precision.

The cosmic-ray Sun shadow, which is caused by high-energy charged cosmic rays
being blocked and deflected by the Sun and its magnetic field, has been
observed by various experiments such as Argo-YBJ, HAWC, Tibet, and IceCube.
Most notably, the shadow's size and depth was recently shown to correlate with
the 11-year solar cycle. The interpretation of such measurements, which help to
bridge the gap between solar physics and high-energy particle astrophysics,
requires a solid theoretical understanding of cosmic-ray propagation in the
coronal magnetic field. It is the aim of this paper to establish theoretical
predictions for the cosmic-ray Sun shadow in order to identify observables that
can be used to study this link in more detail. To determine the cosmic-ray Sun
shadow, we numerically compute trajectories of charged cosmic rays in the
energy range of 5 to 316 TeV for five different mass numbers. We present and
analyse the resulting shadow images for protons and iron, as well as for
typically measured cosmic-ray compositions. We confirm the observationally
established correlation between the magnitude of the shadowing effect and both
the mean sunspot number and the polarity of the magnetic field during the solar
cycle. We also show that during low solar activity, the Sun's shadow behaves
similarly to that of a dipole, for which we find a non-monotonous dependence on
energy. In particular, the shadow can become significantly more pronounced than
the geometrical disk expected for a totally unmagnetized Sun. For times of high
solar activity, we instead predict the shadow to depend monotonously on energy,
and to be generally weaker than the geometrical shadow for all tested energies.
These effects should become visible in energy-resolved measurements of the Sun
shadow, and may in the future become an independent measure for the level of
disorder in the solar magnetic field.
